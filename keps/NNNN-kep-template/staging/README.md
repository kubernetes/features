# KEP Template Staging Directory

This directory should be used to make changes to the KEP Template. All PRs changing the KEP template should be targeted at this diretory. 

Once changes are collected the Enhancements Sub Project will review the final draft, ensure that all tools work with the new changes and formally release a new version of the template. The old template will then be deprecated and moved to the archives directory.
