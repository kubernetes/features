## Release Signoff Checklist

**ACTION REQUIRED:** In order to merge code into a release, there must be an issue in [kubernetes/enhancements] referencing this KEP and targeting a release milestone **before [Enhancement Freeze](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases)
of the targeted release**.

For enhancements that make changes to code or processes/procedures in core Kubernetes i.e., [kubernetes/kubernetes], we require the following Release Signoff checklist to be completed.

Check these off as they are completed for the Release Team to track. These checklist items _must_ be updated for the enhancement to be released.

- [x] kubernetes/enhancements issue in release milestone, which links to KEP (this should be a link to the KEP location in kubernetes/enhancements, not the initial KEP PR)
- [x] KEP approvers have set the KEP status to `implementable`
- [ ] Design details are appropriately documented
- [ ] Test plan is in place, giving consideration to SIG Architecture and SIG Testing input
- [ ] Graduation criteria is in place
- [ ] "Implementation History" section is up-to-date for milestone
- [ ] User-facing documentation has been created in [kubernetes/website], for publication to [kubernetes.io]
- [ ] Supporting documentation e.g., additional design documents, links to mailing list discussions/SIG meetings, relevant PRs/issues, release notes

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable` or significant changes once it is marked `implementable` should be approved by each of the KEP approvers. If any of those approvers is no longer appropriate than changes to that list should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or SIG-arch for cross cutting KEPs).

**Note:** This checklist is iterative and should be reviewed and updated every time this enhancement is being considered for a milestone.

## Summary

This KEP generalizes the existing max-in-flight request handler in the
apiserver to make more distinctions among requests and provide
prioritization and fairness among the categories of requests.  An
outline of the request handling in an apiserver can be found at
https://speakerdeck.com/sttts/kubernetes-api-codebase-tour?slide=18 .

## Motivation

Today the apiserver has a simple mechanism for protecting itself
against CPU and memory overloads: max-in-flight limits for mutating
and for readonly requests.  Apart from the distinction between
mutating and readonly, no other distinctions are made among requests;
consequently there can be undesirable scenarios where one subset of
the request load crowds out other parts of the request load.  Also,
the dispatching of these requests against two independent limits is
not
[work-conserving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-conserving_scheduler).

### Goals

Following are some bad scenarios that can happen today and which
should be preventable when this KEP is in place.

- Self-Maintenance crowded out.  Some requests are for system
  self-maintenance, such as: node heartbeats, kubelet and kube-proxy
  work on pods, services, secrets, etc involved in the system's
  self-hosting, and leader elections for system controllers.  In an
  overload scenario today there is no assurance of priority for these
  self-maintenance requests.

- Priority Inversions.  In the course of serving request A, there are
  some other requests B spawned --- directly or indirectly.  One
  example is requests B that arrive over a loopback connection ---
  such as requests issued by an admission plugin (e.g., ResourceQuota)
  or any client-ish code in a registry strategy.  Another example is
  requests issued by an external server that itself is serving
  call-outs from an apiserver (e.g., admission web-hooks).  Other
  examples include requests from an aggregated apiserver to create
  TokenReview and SubjectAccessReview objects.  Today it is possible
  that the very load imposed by request A crowds out requests B
  involved in serving A.

- Guaranteed capacity for Low Priority.  There can be thundering herds
  with higher priority running many minutes in the cluster. In order
  to prevent an outage for the normal users connecting the cluster,
  requests with higher priority will not completely starve out the
  whole capacity.

- Garbage Collector crowded out.  The garbage collector should keep up
  with the workload, but in an overload situation today this is not
  assured to happen.

- Deployment of Doom.  We had a situation where a bug in the
  Deployment controller caused it to run amuck under certain
  circumstances, issuing requests in a tight loop.  We would like
  controller bugs to not take the whole system down.

- Kubelet Amuck.  The controller that runs amuck might not be a
  central singleton, it could be a kubelet, kube-proxy, or other
  per-node or otherwise multiplied controller.  In such a situtation
  we would like only the guilty individual to suffer, not all its
  peers and the rest of the system.

- Overbearing or buggy tenants.  In a multi-tenant scenario, we would
  like to prevent some tenants from crowding out the others.  Various
  usage scenarios involve identifying the tenant in the following
  ways.
  
  - Each tenant corresponds with a kube API namespace.

  - Each tenant corresponds with a user name.

  - Each tenant corresponds with a prefix of the user name.

  - Each tenant corresponds with a user's group.  Other groups may
    exist.  There is a subset of the groups that serve to identify
    tenants.  Each user belongs to exactly one of the
    tenant-identifying groups.

This KEP introduces a new functionality that is supposed to address the
problems above. The goals/requirements for the solution (in the priority
order) are the following:
1. overload protection
1. fairness
1. throughput

So in other words, first of all we want to protect Kubernetes from overload,
within these boundaries make it fair across tenants and only with those
constraints optimize throughput.

This KEP introduces new functionality in apiservers, and it should be
possible to monitor this functionality through Prometheus metrics
available from the apiservers.

This KEP introduces new configuration objects, and they really
matter; it should be easy to apply suitable access controls.

There should be some reasonable defaults.

### Non-Goals

This will be our first cut at a significant area of functionality, and
our goals are deliberately modest.  We want to implement something
useful but limited and get some experience before going further.  Our
precise modesty has not been fully agreed.  Following is an initial
stake in the ground.

- No coordination between apiservers nor with a load balancer is
  attempted.  In this KEP each apiserver independently protects
  itself.  We imagine that later developments may add support for
  informing load balancers about the load state of the apiservers.

- The fairness does not have to be highly precise.  Any rough fairness
  will be good enough.

- CONNECT requests are out of scope.  These are of a fairly
  different nature than the others, and their management will be more
  complex.  Also they are arguably less of an observed problem.

- We are only concerned with protection of the CPU and memory of the
  apiserver.  We are not concerned with etcd performance, nor output
  network bandwidth, nor the ability of clients to consume output.

- This KEP will not attempt auto-tuning the capacity limit(s).  Instead
  the administrator will configure each apiserver's capacity limit(s),
  analogously to how the max-in-flight limits are configured today.

- This KEP will not attempt to reproduce the functionality of the
  existing event rate limiting admission plugin.  Events are a
  somewhat special case.  For now we intend to simply leave the
  existing admission plugin in place.

- This KEP will not attempt to protect against denial-of-service
  attacks at lower levels in the stack; it is only about what can be
  done at the identified point in the handler chain.

- This KEP does not introduce threading of additional information
  through webhooks and/or along other paths to support avoidance of
  priority inversions.  While that is an attractive thing to consider
  in the future, this KEP is deliberately limited in its ambition.
  The intent for this KEP is to document that for the case of requests
  that are secondary to some other requests the configuration should
  identify those secondary requests and give them sufficiently high
  priority to avoid priority inversion problems.  That will
  necessarily be approximate, and we settle for that now.

### Future Goals

To recap, there are some issues that we have decided not to address
yet but we think may be interesting to consider in the future.

- Helping load balancers do a better job, considering each apiserver's
  current load state.

- Do something about WATCH and/or CONNECT requests.

- React somehow to etcd overloads.

- Generate information to help something respond to downstream
  congestion.

- Auto-tune the resource limit(s) and/or request cost(s).

- Be more useful for events.

- Thread additional information along the paths needed to enable more
  precisely targeted avoidance of priority inversions.

## Proposal

In short, this proposal is about generalizing the existing
max-in-flight request handler in apiservers to add more discriminating
handling of requests.  The overall approach is that each request is
categorized to a priority level and a queue within that priority
level; each priority level dispatches to its own isolated concurrency
pool; within each priority level queues compete with even fairness.

### Request Categorization

Upon arrival at the handler, a request is assigned to exactly one
_priority level_ and exactly one _flow_ within that priority level.
This is done by matching the request against a configured set of
FlowSchema objects.  This will pick exactly one best matching
FlowSchema, and that FlowSchema will identify a RequestPriority object
and the way to compute the request’s flow identifier.

A RequestPriority object defines a priority level.  Each one is either
_exempt_ or not.  There should be at most one exempt priority level.
Being exempt means that requests of that priority are not subject to
concurrency limits (and thus are never queued) and do not detract from
the concurrency available for non-exempt requests.  In a more
sophisticated system, the exempt priority level would be the highest
priority level.

It is expected that there will be only a few RequestPriority objects.
It is expected that there may be a few tens of FlowSchema objects.  At
one apiserver there may be tens of thousands of flow identifiers seen
close enough in time to have some interaction.

A flow is identified by a pair of strings: the name of the FlowSchema
and a "flow distinguisher" string.  The flow distinguisher is computed
from the request according to a rule that is configured in the
FlowSchema.

Each FlowSchema has:
- A boolean test of an authenticated request;
- A matching precedence (default value is 1000);
- A reference to a RequestPriority object; and
- An optional rule for computing the request’s flow distinguisher; not
  allowed for a FlowSchema that refers to a RequestPriority that is
  exempt or has just one queue.

Each RequestPriority has:
- An `exempt` boolean (which defaults to `false`).
- A `catchAll` boolean (which defaults to `false`), which is relevant
  only to default behavior.

Each non-exempt RequestPriority also has:
- A non-negative integer AssuredConcurrencyShares;
- A number of queues; and
- A queue length limit.

Each non-exempt RequestPriority with more than one queue also has:
- A hand size (a small positive number).

The best matching FlowSchema for a given request is one of those whose
boolean test accepts the request.  It is a configuration error if
there is no FlowSchema that matches every request.  In case multiple
schemas accept the request, the best is one of those with the
logically highest matching precedence.  In case there are multiple of
those the implementation is free to pick any of those as best.  A
matching precedence is an integer, and a numerically lower number
indicates a logically higher precedence.

A FlowSchema’s boolean test is constructed from atomic tests.  Each
atomic test compares an authenticated request attribute --- selected
from _either_ the client identity attributes or those that
characterize the work being requested --- with a literal value
(scalar, pattern, or set).  For every available atomic test, its
inverse is also available.  Atomic tests can be ANDed together.  Those
conjunctions can then be ORed together.  The predicate of a FlowSchema
is such a disjunction.

A FlowSchema’s rule for computing the request’s flow distinguisher
identifies a string attribute of the authenticated request and
optionally includes a transformation.  The available string attributes
are (1) namespace of a resource-oriented request (available only if
the predicate accepts only resource-oriented requests) and (2)
username.  If no transformation is indicated then the flow
distinguisher is simply the selected request attribute.  There is only
one transformation available, and it is based on a regex that is
configured in the flow schema and contains a capturing group.  The
transformation consists of doing a complete match against the regex
and extracting submatch number 1; if the selected string does not
match the regex then the transformation yields the empty string.

### Assignment to a Queue

A non-exempt RequestPriority object also has a number of queues (we
are talking about a number here, not the actual set of queues; the
queues exist independently at each apiserver).  If the
RequestPriority’s number of queues is more than one then the following
logic is used to assign a request to a queue.

For a given priority at a given apiserver, each queue is identified by
a numeric index (starting at zero).  A RequestPriority has a hand size
H (so called because the technique here is an application of shuffle
sharding), a small positive number.  When a request arrives at an
apiserver the request flow identifier’s string pair is hashed and the
hash value is used to shuffle the queue indices and deal a hand of
size H, as follows.  We use a hash function that produces at least 64
bits, and 64 of those bits are taken as an unsigned integer we will
call V.  The next step is finding the unique set of integers A[0] in
[0, numQueues), A[1] in [0, numQueues-1), … A[H-1] in
[0, numQueues-(H-1)), A[H] >= 0 such that V = sum[i=0, 1, ...H] A[i] *
ff(numQueues, i), where ff(N, M) is the falling factorial N!/(N-M)!.
The probability distributions of each of these A’s will not be
perfectly even, but we constrain the configuration such that
ff(numQueues, H) is less than 2^60 to keep the unevenness small.  Then
the coefficients A[0], … A[H-1] are converted into queue indices I[0],
… I[H-1] as follows.  I[0] = A[0].  I[1] is the A[1]’th entry in the
list of queue indices excluding I[0].  I[2] is the A[2]’th entry in
the list of queue indices excluding I[0] and I[1].  And so on.

The lengths of the queues identified by I[0], I[1], … I[H-1] are
examined, and the request is put in one of the queues holding the
least amount of work.  Originally this was just a matter of examining
queue length.  With the generalizations for width and extra latency,
the work in a queue is the sum of the work in its waiting requsts.
The work in a request is the product of its width and its total
estimated execution duration (including extra latency).

For example, if a RequestPriority has numQueues=128 and handSize=6,
the hash value V is converted into 6 unique queue indices plus
3905000064000*A[6].  There are 128 choose 6, which is about 5.4
billion, sets of 6 integers in the range [0,127].  Thus, if there is
one heavy flow and many light flows, the probability of a given light
flow hashing to the same set of 6 queues as the heavy flow is about
one in 5.4 billion.

It is the queues that compete fairly.

Since the assignment to queues is based on flows, a useful
configuration will be one in which flows are meaningful boundaries for
confinement/competition.  For bad example, if a particular
FlowSchema's flows are based on usernames and bad behavior correlates
with namespace then the bad behavior will be spread among all the
queues of that schema's priority.  Administrators need to make a good
choice for how flows are distinguished.

#### Queue Assignment Proof of Concept

The following golang code shows a simple recursive technique to
shuffle, deal, and pick.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
	"math/rand"
)

var numQueues uint64

func shuffleDealAndPick(v, nq uint64,
	lengthOfQueue func(int) int,
	mr func( /*in [0, nq-1]*/ int) /*in [0, numQueues-1] and excluding previously determined members of I*/ int,
	nRem, minLen, bestIdx int) int {
	if nRem < 1 {
		return bestIdx
	}
	vNext := v / nq
	ai := int(v - nq*vNext)
	ii := mr(ai)
	i := numQueues - nq // i is used only for debug printing
	mrNext := func(a /*in [0, nq-2]*/ int) /*in [0, numQueues-1] and excluding I[0], I[1], ... ii*/ int {
		if a < ai {
			fmt.Printf("mr[%v](%v) going low\n", i, a)
			return mr(a)
		}
		fmt.Printf("mr[%v](%v) going high\n", i, a)
		return mr(a + 1)
	}
	lenI := lengthOfQueue(ii)
	fmt.Printf("Considering A[%v]=%v, I[%v]=%v, qlen[%v]=%v\n\n", i, ai, i, ii, i, lenI)
	if lenI < minLen {
		minLen = lenI
		bestIdx = ii
	}
	return shuffleDealAndPick(vNext, nq-1, lengthOfQueue, mrNext, nRem-1, minLen, bestIdx)
}

func main() {
	numQueues = uint64(128)
	handSize := 6
	hashValue := rand.Uint64()
	queueIndex := shuffleDealAndPick(hashValue, numQueues, func (idx int) int {return idx % 10}, func(i int) int { return i }, handSize, math.MaxInt32, -1)
	fmt.Printf("For V=%v, numQueues=%v, handSize=%v, chosen queue is %v\n", hashValue, numQueues, handSize, queueIndex)
}
```

#### Probability of Collisions

The following code tabulates some probabilities of collisions.
Specifically, if there are `nHands` elephants, `probNextCovered` is
the probability that a random mouse entirely collides with the
elephants.  This is assuming fair dice and independent choices.  This
is not exactly what we have, but is close.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

// sum computes the sum of the given slice of numbers
func sum(v []float64) float64 {
	c := append([]float64{}, v...)
	sort.Float64s(c) // to minimize loss of accuracy when summing
	var s float64
	for i := 0; i < len(c); i++ {
		s += c[i]
	}
	return s
}

// choose returns the number of subsets of size m of a set of size n
func choose(n, m int) float64 {
	if m == 0 || m == n {
		return 1
	}
	var ans = float64(n)
	for i := 1; i < m; i++ {
		ans = ans * float64(n-i) / float64(i+1)
	}
	return ans
}

// nthDeal analyzes the result of another shuffle and deal in a series of shuffles and deals.
// Each shuffle and deal randomly picks `handSize` distinct cards from a deck of size `deckSize`.
// Each successive shuffle and deal is independent of previous deals.
// `first` indicates that this is the first shuffle and deal.
// `prevDist[nUnique]` is the probability that the number of unique cards previously dealt is `nUnique`,
// and is unused when `first`.
// `dist[nUnique]` is the probability that the number of unique cards dealt up through this deal is `nUnique`.
// `distSum` is the sum of `dist`, and should be 1.
// `expectedUniques` is the expected value of nUniques at the end of this deal.
// `probNextCovered` is the probability that another shuffle and deal will deal only cards that have already been dealt.
func nthDeal(first bool, handSize, deckSize int, prevDist []float64) (dist []float64, distSum, expectedUniques, probNextCovered float64) {
	dist = make([]float64, deckSize+1)
	expects := make([]float64, deckSize+1)
	nexts := make([]float64, deckSize+1)
	if first {
		dist[handSize] = 1
		expects[handSize] = float64(handSize)
		nexts[handSize] = 1 / choose(deckSize, handSize)
	} else {
		for nUnique := handSize; nUnique <= deckSize; nUnique++ {
			conts := make([]float64, handSize+1)
			for news := 0; news <= handSize; news++ {
				// one way to get to nUnique is for `news` new uniques to appear in this deal,
				// and all the previous deals to have dealt nUnique-news unique cards.
				prevUnique := nUnique - news
				ways := choose(deckSize-prevUnique, news) * choose(prevUnique, handSize-news)
				conts[news] = ways * prevDist[prevUnique]
				//fmt.Printf("nUnique=%v, news=%v, ways=%v\n", nUnique, news, ways)
			}
			dist[nUnique] = sum(conts) / choose(deckSize, handSize)
			expects[nUnique] = dist[nUnique] * float64(nUnique)
			nexts[nUnique] = dist[nUnique] * choose(nUnique, handSize) / choose(deckSize, handSize)
		}

	}
	return dist, sum(dist), sum(expects), sum(nexts)
}

func main() {
	handSize := 7
	deckSize := 256
	fmt.Printf("choose(%v, %v) = %v\n", deckSize, handSize, choose(deckSize, handSize))
	var dist []float64
	var probNextCovered float64
	for nHands := 1; probNextCovered < 0.01; nHands++ {
		var distSum, expected float64
		dist, distSum, expected, probNextCovered = nthDeal(nHands == 1, handSize, deckSize, dist)
		fmt.Printf("After %v hands, distSum=%v, expected=%v, probNextCovered=%v, dist=%v\n", nHands, distSum, expected, probNextCovered, dist)
	}
}
```

### Resource Limits

#### Primary CPU and Memory Protection

This proposal controls both CPU and memory consumption of running
requests by imposing a single concurrency limit per apiserver.  It is
expected that this concurrency limit can be set to a value that
provides effective protection of both CPU and memory while not being
too low for either.

The configuration of an apiserver includes a concurrency limit.  This
is a number, whose units is a number of readonly requests served
concurrently.  Unlike in today's max-in-flight handler, the mutating
and readonly requests are commingled without distinction.  The primary
resource limit applied is that at any moment in time the number of
running non-exempt requests should not exceed the concurrency limit.
Requests of an exempt priority are neither counted nor limited, as in
today's max-in-flight handler.  For the remainder, each server's
overall concurrency limit is divided among those non-exempt priority
levels and each enforces its own limit (independently of the other
levels).

At the first stage of development, an apiserver’s concurrency limit
will be derived from the existing configuration options for
max-mutating-in-flight and max-readonly-in-flight, by taking their
sum.  Later we may migrate to a single direct configuration option.
Even later we intend to automatomatically tune the setting of an
apiserver's concurrency limit.

#### Secondary Memory Protection

A RequestPriority is also configured with a limit on the number of
requests that may be waiting in a given queue.

#### Latency Protection

An apiserver is also configured with a limit on the amount of time
that a request may wait in its queue.  If this time passes while a
request is still waiting for service then the request will be
rejected.

This may mean we need to revisit the scalability tests --- this
protection could keep us from violating latency SLOs even though we
are dropping many requests.

### Queuing

Once a request is categorized and assigned to a queue the next
decision is whether to reject or accept that request.

A request of an exempt priority is never rejected and never waits in a
queue; such a request is dispatched as soon as it arrives.

For queuing requests of non-exempt priority, the first step is to
reject all the requests that have been waiting longer than the
configured limit.  Once that is done, the newly arrived request is
considered.  This request is rejected if and only if the total number
of requests waiting in its queue is at least the configured limit on
that number.

A possible alternative would accept the request unconditionally and,
if that made the queue too long, reject the request at the head of the
queue.  That would be the preferred design if we were confident that
rejection will cause the client to slow down.  Lacking that
confidence, we choose to reject the youngest rather than the oldest
request of the queue, so that an investment in holding a request in a
queue has a chance of eventually getting useful work done.

### Dispatching

Requests of an exempt priority are never held up in a queue; they are
always dispatched immediately.  Following is how the other requests
are dispatched at a given apiserver.

The concurrency limit of an apiserver is divided among the non-exempt
priority levels in proportion to their assured concurrency shares.
This produces the assured concurrency value (ACV) for each non-exempt
priority level:

```
ACV(l) = ceil( SCL * ACS(l) / ( sum[priority levels k] ACS(k) ) )
```

where SCL is the apiserver's concurrency limit and ACS(l) is the
AssuredConcurrencyShares for priority level l.

Dispatching is done independently for each priority level.  Whenever
(1) a non-exempt priority level's number of running requests is below
the level's assured concurrency value and (2) that priority level has
a non-empty queue, it is time to dispatch another request for service.
The Fair Queuing for Server Requests algorithm below is used to pick a
non-empty queue at that priority level.  Then the request at the head
of that queue is dispatched.

#### Fair Queuing for Server Requests

This is based on fair queuing but is modified to deal with serving
requests in an apiserver instead of transmitting packets in a router.
You can find the original fair queuing paper at
[ACM](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=75247.75248) or
[MIT](http://people.csail.mit.edu/imcgraw/links/research/pubs/networks/WFQ.pdf),
and an
[implementation outline at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_queuing).
Our problem differs from the normal fair queuing problem in three
ways.  One is that we are dispatching requests to be served rather
than packets to be transmitted.  Another difference is that multiple
requests may be served at once.  The third difference is that the
actual service time (i.e., duration) is not known until a request is
done being served.

To show how to cope with those differences, we start by re-casting the
original fair queuing story in a way that is more amenable to the
needed changes and has the same implementation.  Then we work through
a series of three changes.

##### The original story

We have a collection of FIFO queues of packets to be transmitted, one
packet at a time, over one link that goes at a fixed rate of
`mu_single` (quantified in bits/second).  We imagine a virtual world
called bit-by-bit round-robin (BR), in which the transmitter serves
the queues in a round-robin fashion but advances from one queue to the
next not on packet boundaries but rather on bit boundaries.  We define
a function of time R(t) that counts the number of "rounds" completed,
where a round is sending one bit from each non-empty queue.  We also
define `NAQ(a time)` to be the number of "active" or "non-empty"
queues at that time in the virtual world (there is a precise
formulation later).  With these definitions in hand we can see that

```
R(t) = Integral[from tau=start_of_story to tau=t] (
    if NAQ(tau) > 0 then mu_single / NAQ(tau) else 0) dtau
```

Next we define start and finish R values for each packet:

```
S(i,j) = max(F(i,j-1), R(t_arrive(i,j)))
F(i,j) = S(i,j) + len(i,j) 
```

where:
- `S(i,j)` is the R value for the start of the j'th packet of queue i,
- `F(i,j)` is the R value for the finish of the j'th packet of queue i,
- `len(i,j)` is the number of bits in that packet, and
- `t_arrive(i,j)` is the time when that packet arrived.

Now we can define `NAQ(t)` precisely: it is the number of queues `i`
for which there exists a `j` such that `R(t) <= F(i,j)` and
`t_arrive(i,j) <= t`.

When it is time to start transmitting the next packet in the real
world, we pick the unsent packet with the smallest `F` value.  If
there is a tie then we pick the one whose queue follows most closely
in round-robin order the queue last picked from.

It is not necessary to explicitly represent the S and F values for
every unsent packet in the virtual world.  It suffices to track R(t)
and, for each queue, the contents of that queue and the S of the
queue's oldest unsent packet.  This is enough to make the cost of
reacting to a packet arrival or completion O(1) with the exception of
finding the next packet to send.  That costs O(num queues) in a
straightforward implementation and O(log(num queues) + (num ties)) if
the queues are kept in a data structure sorted by the F value of the
queue's oldest packet that has not started transmission.

##### Re-casting the original story

The original fair queuing technique can be understood in the following
way, which corresponds more directly to max-min fairness.  We have a
collection of FIFO queues of packets to be transmitted, one packet at
a time, over one link that goes at a fixed rate of `mu_single` (in
units of bits/second).  We imagine a virtual world called concurrent
service (CS), in which transmission is proceeding for all the
non-empty queues concurrently; queue `i` is transmitted at rate
`mu(i,t)` at time `t`.  At any given `t` the allocations are given by

```
mu(i,t) = min(rho(i,t), mu_fair(t))
```

where:
- `i` identifies a queue,
- `rho(i,t)` is the rate requested by queue `i` at time `t` and is
  defined to be the product of `mu_single` and the number of packets
  of that queue that are not fully sent in the virtual world at time
  `t` (those for which `t_arrive(i,j) <= t` and whose transmission
  completes strictly after `t`), and
- `mu_fair(t)` is the smallest non-negative quantity that solves the equation
  ```
  min(mu_single, Sum[over i] rho(i,t)) = Sum[over i] min(rho(i,t), mu_fair(t))
  ```

That implies that `mu(i,t)` is zero for each empty queue and
`mu_single / (number of non-empty queues at time t)` for each
non-empty queue, where emptiness is judged in the virtual world.

In the virtual world bits are transmitted from queue `i` at rate
`mu(i,t)`, for every non-empty queue `i`.  Each time when a queue
transitions from empty to non-empty is when bits start being sent from
that queue in the virtual world; the solution `mu_fair(t)` gets
adjusted at this time, among others.  In this virtual world a queue's
packets are divided into three subsets: those that have been
completely sent, those that are in the process of being sent, and
those that have not yet started being sent.  That number being sent is
1 unless it is 0 and the queue has no unsent packets.  This virtual
world uses the same clock as the real world.  Whenever a packet
finishes being sent in the real world, the next packet to be
transmitted is the one that is unsent in the real world and will
finish being sent soonest in the virtual world.  If there is a tie
among several, we pick the one whose queue is next in round-robin
order (following the queue last picked).

We can define beginning and end times (B and E) for transmission of
the j'th packet of queue i in the virtual world, with the following
equations.

```
B(i,j) = max(E(i,j-1), t_arrive(i,j))
Integral[from tau=B(i,j) to tau=E(i,j)] mu(i,tau) dtau = len(i,j)
```

This has a practical advantage over the original story: the integrals
are only over the lifetime of a single request's service --- rather
than over the lifetime of the server.  This makes it easier to use
floating or fixed point representations with sufficient precision.

Note that computing an E value before it has arrived requires
predicting the course of `mu(i,t)` from now until E arrives.  However,
because all the non-empty queues have the same value for `mu(i,t)`
(i.e., `mu_fair(t)`), we can safely make whatever assumption we want
without distorting the dispatching choice --- all non-empty queues are
affected equally, so even wildly wrong guesses don't change the ordering.

The correspondence with the original telling of the fair queuing story
goes as follows.  Equate

```
S(i,j) = R(B(i,j))
F(i,j) = R(E(i,j))
```

The recurrence relations for S and F correspond to the recurrence
relations for B and E.

```
S(i,j) = R(B(i,j))
       = R(max(E(i,j-1), t_arrive(i,j)))
       = max(R(E(i,j-1)), R(t_arrive(i,j)))
       = max(F(i,j-1), R(t_arrive(i,j)))
```

(R and max commute because both are monotonically non-decreasing).

Note that `mu_fair(t)` is exactly the same as `dR/dt` in the original
story (excepting inconsequential differences at the instants when
packets complete: `rho` is defined to exclude the packat at that
instant and `NAQ` is defined to include the packet; the differences
are inconsequential because all we do with `mu` and `dR/dt` in the
argument below is integrate them, and a difference in the integrand at
a countable number of instants makes zero difference to the integral).
So we can reason as follows.

```
Integral[tau=B(i,j) to tau=E(i,j)] mu(i,tau) dtau = len(i,j)

Integral[tau=start to tau=E(i,j)] (dR/dt)(tau) dtau -
Integral[tau=start to tau=B(i,j)] (dR/dt)(tau) dtau
= len(i,j)

R(E(i,j)) - R(B(i,j)) = len(i,j)

F(i,j) - S(i,j) = len(i,j)

F(i,j) = S(i,j) + len(i,j)
```

It is not necessary to track the B and E values for every unsent
packet in the virtual world.  It suffices to track, for each queue
`i`, the following things in the virtual world:
- the packets that have not yet finished transmission
  (this is a superset of the packets that have not yet finished transmission
   in the real world);
- B of the packet currently being sent
- bits of that packet sent so far: `Integral[from tau=B to tau=now] mu(i,tau) dtau`

At any point in time the E of the packet being sent can be calculated,
under the assumption that `mu(i,t)` will henceforth be constant, by
adding to the current time the quotient of (remaining bits to send) /
`mu(i,t)`.  The E of the packet after that can be calculated by
further adding the quotient (size of packet) / `mu(i,t)`.  One of
those two packets is the next one to send in the real world.

If we are satisfied with an O(num queues) cost to react to advancing
the clock or picking a request to dispatch then a direct
implementation of the above works.

It is possible to reduce those costs to O(log(num queues)) by
leveraging the above correspondence to work with R values and keep the
queues in a data structure sorted by the F of the next packet to
finish transmission in the virtual world.  There will be two classes
of queues: those that do not and those that do have a packet waiting
to start transmission in the real world.  It is the latter class that
is kept in the data structure.  A packet's F does not change as the
system evolves over time, so an incremental step requires only
manipulating the queue and packet directly involved.

##### From one to many

The first change is to suppose that transmission is being done on
multiple parallel links.  Call the number of them `C`.  This allows
`mu_fair` to be higher.  Its constraint changes to

```
min(C*mu_single, Sum[over i] rho_i) = Sum[over i] min(rho_i, mu_fair)
```

Because we now have more possible values for `mu(i,t)` than 0 and
`mu_fair(t)`, it is more computationally complex to adjust the
`mu(i,t)` values when a packet arrives or completes virtual service.
That complexity is:
- `O(n log n)`, where n is the number of queues, in a straightforward
  implementation that sorts the queues by increasing rho and then
  enumerates them to find the least demanding, if any, that can not
  get all it wants;
- `O((1 + n_delta) * log n)` if the queues are kept in a
  logarithmic-complexity sorted data structure (such as skip-list or
  red-black tree) ordered by `rho(i,t)`, `n_delta` is the number of
  queues that enter or leave the relationship `mu(i,t) == rho(i,t)`,
  and a pointer to that boundary in the sorted data structure is
  maintained.  Note that in a system that stays out of overload,
  `n_delta` stays zero.  The same result obtains while the system
  stays overloaded by a fixed few queues.

In order to maintain the useful property that transmissions finish in
the virtual world no sooner than they do in the real world (which is
good because it means we do not have to revise history in the virtual
world when a completion comes earlier than expected --- which
possibility we introduce below) we suppose in the virtual world that
each queue `i` has its `min(rho(i,t), C)` oldest unsent packets being
transmitted at time `t`, using equal shares of `mu(i,t)`.  The
following equations define that set of packets (`SAP`), the size of
that set (`NAP`), and the `rate` at which each of them is being sent.

```
SAP(i,t) = {j such that B(i,j) <= t < E(i,j)}

NAP(i,t) = |SAP(i,t)|

rate(i,t) = if NAP(i,tau) > 0 then mu(i,t) / NAP(i,t) else 0
```

Following is an outline of a proof that `rate(i,t) <= mu_single` ---
that is, a packet is transmitted no faster in the virtual world than
in the real world.  When `rate(i,t) == 0` we are already done.  When
`rho(i,t) >= C`: `mu(i,t) <= mu_single * C` and `NAP(i,t) = C`, so
their quotient can not exceed `mu_single`.  When `0 < rho(i,t) < C`:
`mu(i,t) <= mu_single * rho(i,t)` and `NAP(i,t) = rho(i,t)`, whose
quotient is also thusly limited.

The following equations say when transmissions begin and end in this
virtual world.  To make the logic simple, we assume that each packet
arrives at a different time (the implementation will run this logic
with a mutex locked and thus naturally process arrivals serially,
effectively standing them apart in time even if the clock does not).

```
B(i,j) = if NAP(i,t_arrive(i,j)) <= C then t_arrive(i,j)
         else min[k in SAP(i,j)] E(i,k)

Integral[from tau=B(i,j) to tau=E(i,j)] rate(i,tau) dtau = len(i,j)
```

Those equations look dangerously close to circular logic: `B` is
defined in terms of `SAP`, and `SAP` is defined in terms of `B`.  But
note that the equation for `B` says that the start of transmission for
a packet (i) can only be delayed because of `C` other packets that
started transmission earlier (remember, distinct arrival times) and
have not finished yet and (ii) can only be delayed until the first one
of those finishes.  There is only one choice of `B` for each packet
that makes all the equations hold.

Note that when C is 1 these equations produce the same begin and end
times as the single-link design.

As in the single-link case, at any given time we can estimate expected
end times for packets in progress.  These estimates may not be
accurate, but simple estimates can be defined that nonetheless yield
the correct ordering among a queue's packets.  Furthermore, these
estimates will correctly identify the next packet to complete among
all the queues, even though it may say incorrect things about
subsequent events.  That is enough, because the implemenation will
update the estimates every time a packet begins or ends transmission.

To help define these estimates we first define a concept `P(i,t)`, the
"progress" made by a given queue up to a given time.  It might be
described as the number of bits transmitted serially (that is,
considering only one link at any given time) since an arbitrary
queue-specific starting time `epoch(i)`.  A given active packet gets
transmitted at the rate that `P` increases.

```
P(i,t) = Integral[from tau=epoch(i) to tau=t] rate(i,t) dtau
```

We can accumulate `P(i)` in a 64-bit number and only rarely need to
advance `epoch(i)` in order to prevent overflow or troublesome loss of
precision.  Advancing `epoch(i)` will cost O(number of active
packets), to make the corresponding updates to the `PEnd` values
introduced below.

For a given queue `i` and packet `j`, by looking at the `P` value when
the packet begins transmission and adding the length of the packet, we
get the `P` value when the packet will finish transmission.  By
focusing on `P` values instead of wall clock time we gain independence
from the variations in `rate`.  This is similar to the use of `R`
values in the original Fair Queuing scheme.

```
PEnd(i,j) = P(i, B(i,j)) + len(i,j)
```

For a given queue `i` at a given time `t` we can write the expected
end (EE) time of each active packet `j` as the current time plus the
expected amount of time needed to transmit the bits that have not
already been transmitted (making the assumption that the current rate
will continue into the future):

```
EE(i,j,t) = t + (PEnd(i,j) - P(i,t)) / rate(i,t)
```

Notice that the remaining time to transmit the packet, `EE(i,j,t)-t`,
is a function of:
- a packet-specific quantity (`PEnd`) that does not change over time,
  and
- queue-specific quantities (`P`, `rate`) that change over time and
  are independent of packet.

The complexity of updating this representation of a queue's expected
end times to account for the passage of time or a change in `mu` does
not require modifying the packet-specific data (`PEnd` values) in this
data structure, thus costs `O(1)`.  Adding or removing a packet or
changing its length (see below) does not require changing the
packet-specific data of the other active packets.

We can keep the active packets of a queue in a logarithmic-complexity
sorted data structure ordered by expected end time.  Adding or
removing a packet from the active set or changing the packet's length
will cost O(log(size of the active set)).

We can divide the non-empty queues into two categories and keep each
in its own data structure.  For the queues that get `mu(i,t) ==
rho(i,t)`, keep them in a logarithmic-complexity sorted data structure
ordered by the earliest expected end time of the queue's active
packets.  Changes to `mu_fair` do not affect this data structure,
except to the degree that they cause queues to enter or leave this
category.

Similarly, we can keep the queues for which `mu(i,t) == mu_fair(t)` in
another sorted data structure ordered by earliest expected end time.
Since `mu(i,t)` is the same for all queues in this category, the
passage of time and changes in `mu_fair` do not change the ordering of
packets or queues in this data structure, except to the degree that
queues enter or leave this category.  The representation of expected
end times in this category gets one more level of indirection, through
that shared `mu_fair`.

When a change in `mu_fair` causes `n_delta` queues to move from one
category to another, it costs `O(n_delta * log num_queues)` to update
these data structures by those moves.

Updating the data structures for a mere change in one queue's `NAP`
has logarithmic cost.

The above discussion concerns the virtual world, which transmits each
packet no more quickly than the real world.  Usually a packet will
finish transmission in the real world before it finishes in the
virtual word.  But it is important to keep each packet in the virtual
world data structure until it is fully transmitted in the virtual
world.  Yet, our ultimate goal is to select the next packet to
complete transmission in the virtual world _from among those packets
that have not yet started transmission in the real world_.  To do this
we maintain, in addition to the full virtual data structures above,
filtered variants that contain only packets that have not yet started
transmission in the real world.  We use the `mu` and `rho` values from
the virtual world in the calculations for the packets in the filtered
data structures.  Whenever it is necessary to identify the earliest
expected end time among all the filtered packets, this can be done
with O(1) complexity.  Finding the earliest from each of the two
categories costs O(1).  Finding the earliest of those (at most) two
also takes O(1).

##### From packets to requests

The next change is from transmitting packets to serving requests.  We
no longer have a collection of C links; instead we have a server
willing to serve up to C requests at once.  Instead of a packet with a
length measured in bits, we have a request with a service duration
measured in seconds.  The units change: `mu_single` and `mu_i` are no
longer in bits per second but rather are in service-seconds per
second; we call this unit "seats" for short.  We now say `mu_single`
is 1 seat.  As before: when it is time to dispatch the next request in
the real world we pick from a queue with a request that will complete
soonest in the virtual world, using round-robin ordering to break
ties.

##### Not knowing service duration up front

The final change removes the up-front knowledge of the service
duration of a request.  Instead, we use a guess `G`.  If and when the
guess turns out to be too short --- that is, its expected end time
arrives in the virtual world but the request has not finished in the
real world --- the guess is increased.  Remember that the virtual
world never serves a request faster than the real world, so whenever
that adjustment is made we are sure that the guess really was too
short.

Essentially always the (eventually adjusted, as necessary) guess will
turn out to be too long.  When the request finishes execution in the
real world, we learn its actual service duration `D`.  The completion
in the virtual world is concurrent or in the future, never the past.
At this point we adjust the expected end time of the request in the
virtual world to be based on `D` rather than the guess.

When the request finishes execution in the virtual world --- which by
this time is an accurate reflection of the true service duration `D`
--- either another request is dispatched from the same queue or all
the remaining requests in that queue start getting faster service.  In
both cases, the service delivery in the virtual world has reacted
properly to the true service duration.

### Support for LIST requests

Up until now, we were assuming that even though the requests aren't
necessarily equally expensive, their actual cost is actually greatly
reflected by the time it took to process them.  But while being processed
each of them is consuming the equal amount of resources.

It works well for requests that are touching only a single object.
However, given the fact that in practise the concurrency limits has to be
set much higher than number of available cores to achieve reasonable system
throughput, this no longer works that well for LIST requests that are orders
of magnitude more expensive.  There are two aspects of that:
- for CPU the hand-wavy way of rationalizing it is that he ratio of time
  the request is processed by the processor to the actual time of processing
  the request starts to visibly differ (e.g. due to I/O waiting time -
  there is communication with etcd in between for example).
- for memory the reasoning is more obvious as we simply keep all elements
  that we process in memory

As a result, kube-apiserver (and etcd) may be able to easily keep with N
simple in-flight requests (e.g. create or get a single Pod), but will explode
trying to process N requests listing all the pods in the system at the same
time.

#### Width of the request

In order to address this problem, we are introducing the concept of `width`
of the request.  Instead of saying that every request is consuming a single
unit of concurrency, we allow for a request to consume `<width>` units of
concurrency while being processed.

This basically means, that the cost of processing a given request is no
longer reflected by its `<processing latency>` and instead its cost is now
equal to `<width> x <processing latency>`.  The rationale behind it is that
the request is now consuming `<width>` concurrency units for the duration
of its processing.

While in theory the `width` can be an arbitrary non-integer number, for
practical reasons, we will assume it actually is an integer.  Given that
our estimations here are very rough anyway that seems a reasonable
simplification that makes dispatching the budget a bit simpler.

#### Determining the width

While one can imagine arbitrarily sophisticated algorithms for it (including
exposing defining the width of requests via FlowSchema API), we want to start
with something relatively simple to first get operational experience with it
before investing into sophisticated algorithms or exposing a knob to users.

In order to determine the function that will be approximating the `width` of
a request, we should first estimate how expensive a particular request is.
And we need to think about both dimensions that we're trying to protect from
overloading (CPU and RAM) and how many concurrency units a request can actually
consume.

Let's start with CPU.  The total cost of processing a LIST request should be
proportional to the number of processed objects.  However, given that in
practice processing a single request isn't parallelized (and the fact that
we generally scale the number of total concurrency units linearly with amount
of available resources), a single request should consume no more than A
concurrency units.  Fortunately that all compiles together because the
`processing latency` of the LIST request is actually proportional to the
number of processed objects, so the cost of the request (defined above as
`<width> x <processing latency>` really is proportaional to the number of
processed objects as expected.

For RAM the situation is actually different.  In order to process a LIST
request we actually store all objects that we process in memory. Given that
memory is uncompressable resource, we effectively need to reserve all that
memory for the whole time of processing that request.  That suggests that
the `width` for the request from the RAM perspective should be proportional
to the number of processed items.

So what we get is that:
```
  width_cpu(N) = min(A, B * N)
  width_ram(N) = D * N
```
where N is the number of items a given LIST request is processing.

The question is how to combine them to a single number.  While the main goal
is to stay on the safe side and protect from the overload, we also want to
maxiumize the utilization of the available concurrency units.
Fortunately, when we normalize CPU and RAM to percentage of available capacity,
it appears that almost all requests are much more cpu-intensive.  Assuming
4GB:1CPU ratio and 10kB average object and the fact that processing larger
number of objects can utilize exactly 1 core, that means that we need to
process 400.000 objects to make the memory cost higher.
This means, that we can afford the potential minor efficiency that extremely
large requests would cause and just approximate it by protecting every resource
independently, which translates to the following function:
```
  width(n) = max(min(A, B * N), D * N)
```
We're going to better tune the function based on experiments, but based on the
above back-of-envelope calculations showing that memory should almost never be
a limiting factor we will apprximate the width simply with:
```
width_approx(n) = min(A, ceil(N / E)), where E = 1 / B
```
Fortunately that logic will be well separated and purely in-memory so we
can decide to arbitrarily adjust it in future releases.

Given that the estimation is well separated piece of logic, we can decide
to replace with much more sophisticated logic later (e.g. whether it is
served from etcd or from cache, whether it is namespaced or not, etc.).

One more important aspect to resolve is what happens if a given priority
level doesn't have enough concurrency units assigned to it. To be on the
safe side we should probably implement borrowing across priority levels.
However, given we don't want to block introducing the `width` concept on
design and implementation of borrowing, until this is done we have two
main options:
- cap the `width` at the concurrency units assigned to the priority level
- reject requests for which we won't be able to allocate enough concurrency
  units

To avoid breaking some users, we will proceed with the first option (when
computing the cap we should also report requests that we believe are too
wide for a given priority level - it would allow operators to adjust configs).
That said, to accommodate for the inaccuracy here we will introduce a concept
of `additional latency` for a request.  This basically means that after the
request finishes in a real world, we still don't mark it as finished in
the virtual world for `additional latency`.
Adjusting virtual time of a queue to do that is trivial.  The other thing
to tweak is to ensure that the concurrency units will not get available
for other requests for that time (because currently all actions are
triggerred by starting or finishing some request).  We will maintain that
possibility by wrapping the handler into another one that will be sleeping
for `additional latence` after the request is processed.

Note that given the estimation for duration of processing the requests is
automatically corrected (both up and down), there is no need to change that
in the initial version.


#### Estimate width of LIST request

Terms:
- `W`: estimated width of the request
- `N`: number of object(s) estimated to be processed for serving this `LIST` request
- `L`: value of the user specified `limit` in the request URI
- `S`: an integer value that represents the semantics of the `LIST` request, we use as a multiplying 
   factor when we estimate the width.


What's not in scope for this iteration:
- `namespaced` or `cluster scoped`: we will not take this into account while estimating
  the width of a `LIST`
- We are not going to use to the Priority Level configuration assigned to this request for width estimation.   
- Use the watch cache interface to know whether this `LIST` will be served from the cache.
- The code site (inside p&f server filter) where we inspect the request query parameters for `LIST`
  is well before these parameters are validated. We will not validate these parameters when we estimate
  the width. We will ignore the fact that the user might have provided invalid data semantically.
- We are going to treat `resourceVersion` as opaque, its value will not be used to estimate `N`.   

While determining the width, we keep in sight the following goals:
- We will inspect the request query parameters and estimate width for the `LIST` request.
- Be pessimistic, assume the worst. We will possibly overestimate the `width` for certain LIST request.


Estimate `S`:

These are the semantics (from https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/api-concepts/#resource-versions)
- `Most Recent`: served from etcd via quorum read
- `Not older than`: at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`
- `Exact`: at the exact resource version provided
- `Continue Token, Exact`: return data at the resource version of the initial paginated list call  
- `Any`: strong consistency is not required, data at any resource version may be served

We want to feed the semantics in to the width estimation process, we can use the following back of the
envelope mapping:
```
S = {'Most Recent'=4 | 'Not older than'=2 | Exact=2 | 'Continue Token, Exact'=2 | 'Any'=1} 
```

Estimate `N`:

- If the specified value of `limit` is invalid then the apiserver will reject the request? in this case we can
  set `N=1`.
- For a valid value of `limit` we know the upper bound of the total number of objects that will be processed, so `N=L`.
- If `limit` is not specified, we should default `N` (a pessimistic default is `500`?), or we can tune it based 
  on metric data, see the section below.
- Whether `continue` token is set should not have any sway on the width estimation:
  - If it is not set, then it is the first of the `chunked` LIST request, depending on `resourceVersion` its semantics
    could be `Most Recent` (most expensive).
  - If it is set, it's a consecutive request and its semantics should be `Exact` which makes it more likely to be
    served from watch cache. But due to HA configuration, the consecutive request(s) may land in a separate 
    apiserver where the watch cache is stale.
    

Estimate `W`:
```
W = S * ceil(transform(N))
```

Serving the request gets exponentially more expensive as the number of objects increase.
A rough version of `transform` can be:
```go
switch {
case N < 10:
  return 2
case N < 100
  return 8
case N < 500
  return 16
case N < 1000
  return 32
default:
  return 64   
}
```

Defaulting `N`:

The following metric tells us the total number of stored objects in etcd
```
name: apiserver_storage_objects
description: Number of stored objects at the time of last check split by kind.",
```
- we can inspect `apiserver_storage_objects` metric with the `resource` associated with the `LIST` request
- we can also check whether the request is `namespaced` or `cluster scoped`

We can use the two data points above, in combination with `limit`, to default `N`


#### Dispatching the request

The hardest part of adding support for LIST requests is dispatching the
requests.  Now in order to start processing a request, it has to accumulate
`<width>` units of concurrency.

The important requirement to recast now is fairness.  As soon a single
request can consume more units of concurrency, the fairness is
no longer about the number of requests from a given queue, but rather
about number of consumed concurrency units.  This justifes the above
definition of adjusting the cost of the request to now be equal to
`<width> x <processing latency>` (instead of just `<processing latency>`).

At the same time, we want to maximally utilize the available capacity.
In other words, we want to minimize the time when some concurrency unit
is not used, but there are requests at a given PL that could use it.

In order to achieve the above goals, we are introducing the following
modification to the current dispatching algorithm:
- as soon as we choose the request to dispatch (i.e. the queue from which
  the first request should be dispatched), we start accumulating concurrency
  units until we accumulate `<width>` and only then dispatch the request.
  In other words, if the chosen request has width `<width>` and there
  are less then `<width>` available seats, we don't dispatch any other request
  (at a given priority level) until we will have `<width>` available seats
  at which point we dispatch this request.
  Such approach (as opposed to dispatching individual concurrency units
  independently one-by-one) allows us to not waste too many seats and avoid
  deadlocks if we would be dispatching seats to multiple LIST requests
  without having enough of them for a given priority level.
- however, to ensure fairness (especially over longer period of times)
  we need to change how virtual time is advanced too.  We will change the
  semantics of virtual time tracked by the queues to correspond to work,
  instead of just wall time.  That means when we estimate a request's
  virtual duration, we will use `estimated width x estimated latency` instead
  of just estimated latecy.  And when a request finishes, we will update
  the virtual time for it with `seats x actual latency` (note that seats
  will always equal the estimated width, since we have no way to figure out
  if a request used less concurrency than we granted it).

However, now the queueing mechanism also requires adjustment.  So far,
when putting a request into the queue, we were choosing the shortest queue.
It worked, because it well proxied the total cost of processing all requests
in that queue.
After the above changes, the size of the queue is no longer correctly
approximating the cost of processing the queued items.  Given that the
total cost of processing a request is now `<width> x <processing latency>`,
the weight of the queue should now reflect that.

### Support for WATCH requests

The next thing to consider is support for long-running requests.  However,
solving it in a generic case is hard, because we don't have any way to
predict how expensive those requests will be.  Moreover, for requests like
port forwarding this is completely outside our control (being application
specific).  As a result, as the first step we're going to limit our focus
to just WATCH requests.

However, even for WATCH requests, there are effectively two separate problems
that has to be considered and addressed.

#### Watch initialization

The first problem is initialization of watch requests.  In this phase we
initialize all the structures, start goroutines, etc. and sync the watch
to "now".  Given that watch requests may be called with potentially quite
old resource version, we may need to go over many events, filter them out
and send the ones that are matching selectors.

We will solve this problem by also handling watch requests by our priority
and fairness kube-apiserver filter.  The queueing and admitting of watch
requests will be happening exactly the same as for all non-longrunning
requests.  However, as soon as watch is initialized, it will be sending
an articial `finished` signal to the APF dispatcher - after receiving this
signal dispatcher will be treating the request as already finished (i.e.
the concurrency units it was occupying will be released and new requests
may potentially be immediately admitted), even though the request itself
will be still running.

However, there are still some aspects that require more detail discussion.

##### Getting the initialization signal

The first question to answer is how we will know that watch initialization
has actually been done.  However, the answer for this question is different
depending on whether the watchcache is on or off.

In watchcache, the initialization phase is clearly separated - we explicily
compute `init events` and process them.  What we don't control at this level
is the process of serialization and sending out the events.
In the initial version we will ignore this and simply send the `initialization
done` signal as soon as all the init events are in the result channel.  In the
future, we can estimate it by assuming some constant (or proportional to
event size) time for an event and delay delivering the signal by the sum of
those across all init events.

If watchcache is disabled, the watch is just proxied to the etcd.  In this
case we don't have an easy way to answer the question whether the watch has
already catch up.  Given that watchcache is enabled by default for all
resources except from events, in the initial version we will simply deliver
the `initialization done` signal as soon as etcd watch is started.  We will
explore how to improve it in the future.

##### Passing the initialization signal to the filter

The second aspect is passing the `initialization done` signal from watchcache
or etcd3 storage layer to the priority and fairness filter.  We will do that
using a synchronization primitives (either channel or WaitGroup) and putting
that into request context.  Given that context is passed down with the request,
watchcache/etcd3 storage will have access to it and will be able to pass the
signal.

##### Width of the request

The performance characteristics of the watch initialization is very different
than processing a regular single-object request, we should (similarly as for
LIST requests) adjust the `width` of the request.  However, in the initial
version, we will just use `width=1` for all watch requests.  In the future,
we are going to evolve it towards a function that will be better estimating
the actual cost (potentially somewhat similarly to how LIST requests are done)
but we first need to a machanism to allow us experiment and tune it better.

#### Keeping the watch up-to-date

Once the watch is initialized, we have to keep it up-to-date with incoming
changes.  That basically means that whenever some object that this particular
watch is interested in is added/updated/deleted, and appropriate event has
to be sent.

Similarly as in generic case of long-running requests, predicting this cost
up front is impossible. Fortunately, in this case we have a full control over
those events, because those are effectively a result of the mutating requests
that out mechanism is explicitly admitting.
So instead of associating the cost of sending watch events to the corresponding
WATCH request, we will reverse the situation and associate the cost of sending
watch events to the mutating request that triggering them.

In other words, we will be throttling the write requests to ensure that
apiserver would be able to keep up with the watch traffic instead of throttling
the watchers themselves.  The main reason for that is that throttling watchers
themselves isn't really effective: we either need to send all objects to them
anyway or in case we close them, they will try to resume from last received
event anyway.  Which means we don't get anything on throttling them.

##### Estimating cost of the request

Let's start with an assumption that sending every watch event is equally
expensive.  We will discuss how to generalize it below.

With the above assumption, a cost of a mutating request associated with
sending watch events triggerred by it is proportional to the number of
watchers that has to process that event.   So let's describe how we can
estimate this number.

Obviously, we can't afford going over all watches to compute that - we need
to keep this information already precomputed. What if we would simply
store an in-memory map from (resource type, namespace, name) tuple into
number of opened watches that are interested in a given event.  The size of
that map won't be larger then the total number of watches, so that is
acceptable.
Note that each watch can also specify label and field selectors.  However,
in most of cases a particular object has to be processed for them anyway
to check if the selectors are satisfied.  So we can ignore those selectors
as the object contributes to the cost (even if it will not be send as not
satisfying the selector).
The only exception to this is caused by a few predefined selectors that
kube-apiserver is optimized for (this includes pods from a given node and
nodes/secrets/configmaps specifying metadata.name field selector).  Given
their simplicity, we can extend our mapping to handle those too.

Having such in-memory map, we can quickly estimate the cost of a request.
It's not as simple as taking a single map item as it requires adding watches
for the whole namespace and all objects of a given type.  But it be done in
O(1) map accesses.
Keeping such map up-to-date is also easy - whenever a new watch start we
increment a corresponding entry, when it ends we decrement it.

##### Multiple apiservers

All the above works well in the case of single kube-apiserver.  But if there
are N kube-apiservers, there is no guarantee that the number of watches are
evenly distributed across them.

To address the problem, individual kube-apiservers has to publish the
information about number of watches for other kube-apiservers.  We obviously
don't want to introduce a new communications channel, so that can be done
only by writing necessary information to the storage layer (etcd).
However, writing a map that can contain tens (or hundreds?) of thousands of
entries wouldn't be efficient. So we need to smartly hash that to a smaller
structure to avoid loosing too much information.
If we would have a hashing function that can combine only a similar buckets
(e.g. it won't combine "all Endpoints" bucket with "pods from node X") then
we can simply write maximum from all entries that are hashed to the same value.
This means that some costs may be overestimated, but if we resaonably hash
requests originating by system components, that seems acceptable.
The above can be achieved by hashing each resource type to a separate set of
buckets, and within a resource type hashing (namespace, name) as simple as:
```
  hash(ns, name) = 0                              if namespace == "" & name == ""
  hash(ns, name) = 1 + hash(namespace)%A          if name == ""
  hash(ns, name) = 1 + A + hash(namespace/name)%B otherwise
```
For small enough A and B (e.g. A=3, B=6), the representation should have less
than 1000 entries, so it would be small enough to make periodic updates in etcd
reasonable.

We can optimize amount of data written to etcd by frequently (say once per
second) checking what changed, but writing rarely (say once per minute) or
if values in some buckets significantly increased.
The above algorithm would allow us to avoid some more complicated time-smearing,
as whenever something quickly grows we report it, but we don't immediately
downscale which is a way to somehow incorporate a history.

However, we will treat the above as a feasibility proof.  We will just start
with the simplest apprach of treating each kube-apiserver independently.
We will implement the above (i.e. knowledge sharing between kube-apiserver),
if the independence assumption will not work good enough.
The above description shows that it won't result in almost any wasted work
if the code will be well structured.

##### Cost of the watch event

We assumed above that the cost of processing every watch event is equal.
However, in practice the cost associated with sending an event consists
of two main parts:
- the cost of going through event change logic
- the cost of processing the event object (e.g. deserialization or sending data
  over network)
The first one is close to equal independently of the event, the second one
is more proportional to the size of the object.
However, estimating size of the object is hard to predict for PATCH or DELETE
requests. Additionally, even for POST or PUT requests where we could potentially
estimate it based on size of the body of the requests, we may not yet have
access to it when we need to make a decision.

One way to estimate it would be to keep a running average of watch event size
per bucket.  While it won't give us an accurate estimate, it should amortize
well over time.

Obviously some normalization will be needed here, but it's impossible to assess
it on paper, and we are leaving this for the implementation and tuning phase
to figure out the details.

##### Dispatching the request

We described how we can estimate the cost of the request associated with
watch events triggerred by it.  But we didn't yet said how this translates
to dispatching the request.

First of all, we need to decide how to translate the estimated cost to the
`width` of the request and its latency.  Second, we need to introduce the
changes to our virtual world, as the fact that the request finished doesn't
mean that sending all associated watch events has also finished (as they are
send asynchronously).

Given that individual watch events are to significant extent processed
independently in individual goroutines, it actually makes sense to adjust the
`width` of the request based on the expected number of triggerred events.
However, we don't want to inflate the width of every single request that is
triggering some watch event (as described in the above sections, setting
the width to greater is reducing our ability to fully utilize our capacity).
The exact function to computing the width should be figured out during
further experiments, but the initial candidate for it would be:
```
  width(request) = min(floor(expected events / A), concurrency units in PL)
```

However, adjusting the width is not enough because, as mentioned above,
processing watch events happens asynchronously.  As a result, we will use
the mechanism of `additional latency` that is described in the section
about LIST requests to compensate for asynchronous cost of the request
(which in virtual world quals `<width> x <additional latency>`.

```

### Reaction to Configuration Changes

We do not seek to make our life easy by making any configuration
object fields immutable.  Recall that objects can be deleted and
replacements (with the same name) created, so server-enforced
immutability of field values provides no useful guarantee to
downstream consumers (such as the request filter here).  We could try
to get useful guarantees by adding a finalizer per (config object,
apiserver), but at this level of development we will not attempt that.

Many details of the configuration are consumed only momentarily;
changes in these pose no difficulty.  Challenging changes include
changes in the number of queues, the queue length limit, or the
assured concurrency value (which is derived from several pieces of
config, as outlined elsewhere) of a request priority --- as well as
deletion of a priority level itself.

An increase in the number of queues of a priority level is handled by
simply adding queues.  A decrease is handled by making a distinction
between the desired and the actual number of queues.  When the desired
number drops below the actual number, the undesired queues are left in
place until they are naturally drained; new requests are put in only
the desired queues.  When an undesired queue becomes empty it is
deleted and the fair queuing round-robin pointer is advanced if it was
pointing to that queue.

When the assured concurrency value of a priority level increases,
additional requests are dispatched if possible.  When the assured
concurrency value decreases, there is no immediate reaction --- this
filter does not abort or suspend requests that are currently being
served.

When the queue length limit of a priority level increases, no
immediate reaction is required.  When the queue length limit
decreases, there is also no immediate reaction --- queues that are
longer than the new length limit are left to naturally shrink as they
are drained by dispatching and timeouts.

When a request priority configuration object is deleted, in a given
apiserver the corresponding implementation objects linger until all
the queues of that priority level are empty.  A FlowSchema associated
with one of these lingering undesired priority levels matches no
requests.

The [Dispatching](#Dispatching) section prescribes how the assured
concurrency value (`ACV`) is computed for each priority level, and the
sum there is over all the _desired_ priority levels (i.e., excluding
the lingering undesired priority levels).  For this reason and for
others, at any given time this may compute for some priority level(s)
an assured concurrency value that is lower than the number currently
executing.  In these situations the total number allowed to execute
will temporarily exceed the apiserver's configured concurrency limit
(`SCL`) and will settle down to the configured limit as requests
complete their service.

### Default Behavior

There must be reasonable behavior "out of the box", and it should be
at least a little difficult for an administrator to lock himself out
of this subsystem.  To accomplish these things there are two levels of
defaulting: one concerning behavior, and one concerning explicit API
objects.

The effective configuration is the union of (a) the actual API objects
that exist and (b) implicitly generated backstop objects.  The latter
are not actual API objects, and might not ever exist as identifiable
objects in the implementation, but are figments of our imagination
used to describe the behavior of this subsystem.  These backstop
objects are implicitly present and affecting behavior when needed.
There are two implicitly generated RequestPriority backstop objects.
One is equivalent to the `system-top` object exhibited above, and it
exists while there is no actual RequestPriority object with `exempt ==
true`.  The other is equivalent to the `workload-low` object exhibited
above, and exists while there is no RequestPriority object with
non-exempt priority.  There are also two implicitly generated
FlowSchema backup objects.  Whenever a request whose groups include
`system:masters` is not matched by any actual FlowSchema object, a
backstop equivalent to the `system-top` object exhibited above is
considered to exist.  Whenever a request whose groups do not include
`system:masters` is not matched by any actual FlowSchema object, the
following backstop object is considered to exist.

```yaml
kind: FlowSchema
meta:
  name: non-top-backstop
spec:
  matchingPriority: (doesn’t really matter)
  requestPriority:
    name: (name of an effectively existing RequestPriority, whether
           that is real or backstop, with catchAll==true)
  flowDistinguisher:
    source: user
    # no transformation in this case
  match:
  - and: [ ] # match everything
```

The other part of the defaulting story concerns making actual API
objects exist, and it goes as follows.  Whenever there is no actual
RequestPriority object with `exempt == true`, the RequestPriority
objects exhibited above are created --- except those with a name
already in use by an existing RequestPriority object.  Whenever there
is no actual FlowSchema object that refers to an exempt
RequestPriority object, the schema objects shown above as examples are
generated --- except those with a name already in use.

### Prometheus Metrics

Prior to this KEP, the relevant available metrics from an apiserver are:
- apiserver_current_inflight_requests (gauge, broken down by mutating or not)
- apiserver_longrunning_gauge
- apiserver_request_count (cumulative number served)
- apiserver_request_latencies (histogram)
- apiserver_request_latencies_summary

This KEP adds the following metrics.
- apiserver_rejected_requests (count, broken down by priority, FlowSchema, when (arrival vs timeout))
- apiserver_current_inqueue_requests (gauge, broken down by priority, FlowSchema)
- apiserver_request_queue_length (histogram, broken down by
  RequestPriority name; buckets set at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 1.0
  times the relevant queue length limit)
- apiserver_current_executing_requests (gauge, broken down by priority, FlowSchema)
- apiserver_dispatched_requests (count, broken down by priority, FlowSchema)
- apiserver_wait_duration (histogram, broken down by priority, FlowSchema)
- apiserver_service_duration (histogram, broken down by priority, FlowSchema)

### Testing

There should be one or more end-to-end tests that exercise the
functionality introduced by this KEP.  Following are a couple of
suggestions.

One simple test would be to use a client like
https://github.com/MikeSpreitzer/k8api-scaletest/tree/master/cmdriverclosed
to drive workload with more concurrency than is configured to be
admitted, and see whether the amount admitted is as configured.

A similar but more sophisticated test would be like the ConfigMap
driver but would create/update/delete objects that have some
non-trivial behavior associated with them.  One possibility would be
ServiceAccount objects.  Creation of a ServiceAccount object implies
creation of a Secret, and deletion also has an implication.  Thrashing
such objects would test that the workload does not crowd out the
garbage collector.


### Observed Requests

To provide data about requests to use in designing the configuration,
here are some observations from a running system late in the
release 1.16 development cycle.  These are extracts from the
kube-apiserver log file, with linebreaks and indentation added for
readability.

The displayed data are a `RequestInfo` from
`k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/endpoints/request` and an `Info` from
`k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/authentication/user`.

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints

TBD

### Risks and Mitigations

Implementing this KEP will increase the overhead in serving each
request, perhaps to a degree that depends on some measure of system
and/or workload size.  The additional overhead must be practically
limited.

There are likely others.

## Design Details

We are still ironing out the high level goals and approach.  Several
earlier proposals have been floated, as listed next.  This section
contains a discussion of the issues.

### Design Considerations

Following is an attempt to summarize the issues addressed in those
proposals and the current thinking on them; the current proposal
attempts to respond.

Despite the open issues, we seem to be roughly agreed on an outline
something like the following.

- When a request arrives at the handler, the request is categorized
  somehow.  The nature of the categories and the categorization
  process is one open issue. Some proposals allow for the request to
  be rejected upon arrival based on that categorization and some local
  state.  Unless rejected, the request is put into a FIFO queue.  That
  is one of many queues.  The queues are associated with the
  categories somehow.  Some proposals contemplate ejecting less
  desirable requests to make room for the newly queued request, if and
  when queue space is tight.

- A request might also be rejected at a later time, based on other
  criteria.  For example, as in the CoDel technique --- which will
  reject a request at the head of the queue if the latency is found to
  be too big at certain times.

- Based on some resource limit (e.g., QPS or concurrency) and with
  regards to priority and fairness criteria, requests are dispatched
  from the queues to be served (i.e., continue down the handler
  chain).

- We assume that when the requst-timeout handler aborts a request it
  is effective --- we assume the request stops consuming CPU and
  memory at that point.  We know that this is not actually true today,
  but is intended; we leave fixing that to be independent work, and
  for now this KEP simply ignores the gap.

One of the biggest questions is how to formulate the scheduling
parameters.  There are several related concepts in the state of the
art of scheduling, and we are trying to figure out what to adopt
and/or invent.  We would prefer to invent as little as possible; it is
a non-trivial thing to invent a new --- and sufficiently efficient ---
scheduling algorithm and prove it correct.  The vmware product line
uses scheduling parameters named "reservation", "limit", and "shares"
for each class of workload.  The first two are known elsewhere as
"assured" and "ceiling".  Finding a published algorithm that
implements all three has not proven easy.  Alternatively, priorities
are easy to implement and arguably more desirable --- provided there
is some form of fairness within each priority level.  The current
thinking is in that direction: use priorities, with simple equal
fairness among some categories of requests in each priority level.
There are published scheduling algorithms that provide fairness, and
we hope to use/adapt one of them to apply independently within the
confines of each priroity level.

Another issue is whether to manage QPS or concurrency or what.
Managing QPS leaps first to mind, perhaps because it is a simple
concept and perhaps because it is familiar from the self-restraint
that clients apply today.  But we want to also take service time into
account; a request flow with longer service times should get less QPS
because its requests are "heavier" --- they impose more load on the
apiserver.  A natural way to do this is with an inverse linear
relation.  For example, when two CPU-bound request flows are getting
equal CPU from the apiserver, and the first flow's requests have a
service time that is X times the service time of the second flow's
requests, the first flow's QPS is 1/X of the second's.  This is
exactly analogous to what happens in networking: if two flows are
getting the same bandwidth, and one flow's packets are X times as big
as the second's, then the first flow's packets per second rate is 1/X
that of the second flow.  This inverse linear relation amounts to
managing the product of QPS * service time.  That is equivalent to
managing concurrency.  Managing concurrency is an obvious choice for
memory, and we now see it is a good choice for CPU too.  This is also
a convenient choice because it is what the max-in-flight handler is
doing today, so we would be making a relatively modest extension to
that handler's conception.

Compared to traditional scheduling problems, ours is harder because of
the combination of these facts: (1) (unlike a router handling a
packet) the apiserver does not know beforehand how long a request will
take to serve nor how much memory it will consume, and (2) (unlike a
CPU scheduler) the apiserver can not suspend and resume requests.
Also, we are generally loathe to abort a request once it has started
being served.  We may some day consider doing this for low-priority
long-running requests, but are not addressing long-running requests at
first.  We are leaning towards adapting well known and studied
scheduling technique(s); but adaptation is a form of invention, and we
have not converged yet on what to do here.

Another issue is how to combine two goals: protection of CPU, and
protection of memory.  A related issue is the fact that there are two
stages of memory consumption: a request held in a queue holds some
memory, and a request being served may use a lot more.  The current
thinking seems to be focusing on using one QPS or concurrency limit on
requests being served, on the expectation that this limit can be set
to a value that provides reasonable protection for both CPU and memory
without being too low for either.

If we only limmit requests being served then the queues could cause
two problems: consuming a lot of apiserver memory, and introducing a
lot of latency.  For the latter we are aware of some solutions from
the world of networking, [CoDel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoDel)
and
[fq_codel](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-aqm-fq-codel-06).
CoDel is a technique for ejecting requests from a queue for the
purpose of keeping latency low, and fq_codel applies the CoDel
technique in each of many queues.  CoDel is explicitly designed to
work in the context of TCP flows on the Internet.  This KEP should be
similarly explicit about the context, particularly including what is
the feedback given to clients and how do they react and what is the
net effect of all the interacting pieces.  No such analysis has yet
been done for any of the proposals.

The CoDel technique is described as parameterless but has two magic
numbers: an "initial interval" of 100 ms and a "target" of 5 ms.  The
initial interval is set based on round trip times in the Internet, and
the target is set based on a desired limit on the latency at each hop.
What are the analogous numbers for our scenario?  We do not have large
numbers of hops; typically at most two (client to main apiserver and
then main apiserver to aggregated apiserver).  What is analogous to
network round trip time?  We have a latency goal of 1 second, and a
request service time limit of 1 minute.  If we take 1 second as the
initial interval then note that the maximum service time is much
larger than the initial interval; by contrast, in networking, the
maximum service time (i.e., packet length / link speed) is much
smaller than the initial interval.  Even if we take 1 minute as our
initial interval, we still do not have the sort of relationship that
obtains in networking.  Note that in order to get good statistics on a
queue --- which is needed by the CoDel technique --- there have to be
many requests served during an interval.  Because of this mismatch,
and because equivalence of context has not been established, we are
not agreed that the CoDel technique can be used.

Note that the resource limit being applied is a distinct concept from
the fairness criteria.  For example, in CPU scheduling there may be 4
CPUs and 50 threads being scheduled onto those CPUs; we do not suppose
the goal is to have each thread to be using 0.08 CPUs at each instant;
a thread uses either 0 or 1 CPUs at a given instant.  Similarly, in
networking, a router may multiplex a thousand flows onto one link; the
goal is not to have each flow use 1/1000th of the link at each
instant; a packet uses 0 links while queued and 1 link while being
transmitted.  Each CPU or link is used for just one thing at a time;
this is the resource limit.  The fairness goal is about utilization
observed over time.  So it is in our scenario too.  For example, we
may have 5000 flows of requests and a concurrency limit of 600
requests at any one time.  That does not mean that our goal is for
each flow to have 0.12 requests running at each instant.  Our goal is
to limit the number of running requests to 600 at each instant and
provide some fairness in utilization averaged over time.

That average over time must not be over too much or too little time.
It would not make sense to average over all past time; that would
allow a flow to build up a huge amount of credit, enabling it to crowd
out other flows.  It also does not make sense for the average to cover
a small amount of time.  Because serving requests, like transmitting
packets, is lumpy we must average over many service times.  Approaches
to this include: using a sequence of intervals, using a sliding
window, and using an exponential decay.

Another open issue is the categorization: what are the categories and
how is a request assigned to a category?  We seem to be agreed on at
least one important point: each request is assigned to exactly one
category, and is handled by exactly one "bucket" or "queue".  We also
seem to be converging toward a two-level hierarchy of categories,
aligned with the handling outline discussed earlier: at the higher
level there are priorities, and within each priority level there is a
collection of flows that compete fairly.

It is desired to allow lesser priority traffic to get some service
even while higher priority traffic is arriving at a sufficient rate to
entirely occupy the server.  There needs to be a quantitative
definition of this relation between the priorities, and an
implementation that (at least roughly) implements the desired
quantitative relation.

For the higher level of categorization --- i.e., into priority levels
--- the idea is that this is based on a configured set of predicate =>
priority associations.  The predicate can test any authenticated
request attribute --- notably including both client identity and the
work being requested.  One issue to nail down is the question of what
happens if multiple predicates match a given request; the handler
should pick exactly one priority level for each request.

Within a given priority level we want to give a fair division of
capacity among several "flows"; the lower level of categorization is
how to compute a flow identifier from a request.

The handler may additionally hash the flows into queues, so that a
more manageable number of queues is involved.  Shuffle sharding can be
used to make it more likely that a mouse can avoid being squashed by
an elephant.

Some of the proposals draw inspiration from deficit (weighted or not)
round robin, and some from (weighted or not) fair queuing.  DRR has
the advantage of O(1) time to make a decision --- but ONLY if the
quantum is larger than the largest packet.  In our case that would be
quite large indeed, since the timeout for a request is typically 1
minute (it would be even worse if we wanted to handle WATCH requests).
The dispatching of the DRR technique is bursty, and the size of the
burst increases with the quantum.  The proposals based on DRR tend to
go with a small quantum, presumably to combat the burstiness.  The
logical extreme of this, in the unweighted case, is to use a quantum
of 1 bit (in the terms of the original networking setting).  That is
isomorphic to (unweighted) fair queuing!  The weighted versions, still
with miniscule quanta, are also isomorphic.

### Test Plan

- __Unit Tests__: All changes must be covered by unit tests. Additionally,
 we need to test the evenness of dispatching algorithm.
- __Integration Tests__: The use cases discussed in this KEP must be covered by integration tests.

### Graduation Criteria

Alpha:

- Necessary defaulting, validation
- Adequate documentation for the changes
- Minimum viable test cases mentioned in Test Plan section

Beta:

- Blocking Items:
  - Improving observability and robustness: adding debug endpoint dumping fine-grained states of the queues for priority-levels
  - Providing approaches to opt-out client-side rate-limitting: configurable client-side ratelimitting(QPS/Burst) via either kubeconfig or command-line flags 
  - Necessary e2e test: adding E2E tests which at least covers:
    - Basics of `flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta1` API 
    - Reloading flowcontrol configurations upon `flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta1` API resources changes
- Non-Blocking Items:
  - Supports concurrency limiting upon long-running requests
  - Allow constant concurrency/relative shares in the priority-level API model
  - Automatically manages versions of mandatory/suggested configuration
  - Discrimates paginated LIST requests

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

* **How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?** To enable
  priority and fairness, all of the following must be enabled:
  - [x] Feature gate
    - Feature gate name: APIPriorityAndFairness
    - Components depending on the feature gate:
      - kube-apiserver
  - [x] Command-line flags
    - `--enable-priority-and-fairness`, and
    - `--runtime-config=flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1alpha1=true`

* **Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?** Yes, requests that
  weren't rejected before could get rejected while requests that were rejected
  previously may be allowed. Performance of kube-apiserver under heavy load
  will likely be different too.

* **Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back
  the enablement)?** Yes.

* **What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?**
  The feature will be restored.

* **Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?** No. Manual tests
  will be run before switching feature gate to beta.

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

* **How can a rollout fail? Can it impact already running workloads?** A
  misconfiguration could cause apiserver requests to be rejected, which could
  have widespread impact such as: (1) rejecting controller requests, thereby
  bringing a lot of things to a halt, (2) dropping node heartbeats, which may
  result in overloading other nodes, (3) rejecting kube-proxy requests to
  apiserver, thereby breaking existing workloads, (4) dropping leader election
  requests, resulting in HA failure, or any combination of the above.

* **What specific metrics should inform a rollback?** An abnormal spike in the
  `apiserver_flowcontrol_rejected_requests_total` metric should potentially be
  viewed as a sign that kube-apiserver is rejecting requests, potentially
  incorrectly. The `apiserver_flowcontrol_request_queue_length_after_enqueue`
  metric getting too close to the configured queue length could be a sign of
  insufficient queue size (or a system overload), which can be precursor to
  rejected requests.

* **Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?**
  No. Manual tests will be run before switching feature gate to beta.

* **Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, 
  fields of API types, flags, etc.?** Yes, `--max-requests-inflights` will be
  deprecated in favor of APF.

### Monitoring Requirements

* **How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?**
  If the `apiserver_flowcontrol_dispatched_requests_total` metric is non-zero,
  this feature is in use. Note that this isn't a workload feature, but a
  control plane one.

* **What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine 
the health of the service?**
  - [x] Metrics
    - Metric name: `apiserver_flowcontrol_request_queue_length_after_enqueue`
    - Components exposing the metric: kube-apiserver

* **What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the above SLIs?**
  No SLOs are proposed for the above SLI.

* **Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability 
of this feature?** No.

### Dependencies

* **Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?**
  No.

### Scalability

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?** Yes.
  Self-requests for new API objects will be introduced. In addition, the
  request execution order may change, which could occasionally increase the
  number of retries.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?**
  Yes, a new flowcontrol API group, configuration types, and status types are
  introduced. See `k8s.io/api/flowcontrol/v1alpha1/types.go` for a full list.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud
  provider?** No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of
  the existing API objects?** No.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any
  operations covered by [existing SLIs/SLOs]?** Yes, a non-negligible latency
  is added to API calls to kube-apiserver. While [preliminary tests](https://github.com/tkashem/graceful/blob/master/priority-fairness/filter-latency/readme.md)
  shows that the API server latency is still well within the existing SLOs,
  more thorough testing needs to be performed.

* **Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of
  resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?** The proposed
  flowcontrol logic in request handling in kube-apiserver will increase the CPU
  and memory overheads involved in serving each request. Note that the resource
  usage will be configurable and may require the operator to fine-tune some
  parameters.

### Troubleshooting

* **How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?**
  The feature is itself within the API server. Etcd being unavailable would
  likely cause kube-apiserver to fail at processing incoming requests.

* **What are other known failure modes?** A misconfiguration could reject
  requests incorrectly. See the rollout and monitoring sections for details on
  which metrics to watch to detect such failures (see the `kep.yaml` file for
  the full list of metrics). The following kube-apiserver log messages could
  also indicate potential issues:
  - "Unable to list PriorityLevelConfiguration objects"
  - "Unable to list FlowSchema objects"

* **What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the
  problem?** No SLOs are proposed.

## Implementation History

(none yet)

## Drawbacks

Increased burden on operator to provide good configuration.

Increase in stuff to consider when analyzing performance results.

Increased complexity of code to maintain.

Increased runtime costs.

## Alternatives

Once we have settled on a design there will be things to say about the
designs not chosen.

## Infrastructure Needed

The end-to-end test suite should exercise the functionality introduced
by this KEP.  This may require creating a special client to submit an
overload of low-priority work.
