## Design Goals

1. High-level concepts and primitives in kubernetes should have
   corresponding concepts in the language.  For instance:

   * Quantity is fundamentally a primitive in Kubernetes, and thus should
     have a corresponding primitive in our IDL.

   * Kind is a fundamental concept in Kubernetes, so it should just be
     possible to declare a kind in the IDL.

2. Kubernetes API requirements should be encoded in the language:
   disallowed constructs (and many bad practices) in Kubernetes APIs
   should not be possible to represent in the IDL.

3. Kubernetes API recommendations should be the default behavior in the
   language: when not explicitly overridden, users should get our
   recommended behavior by default:

   * For example, the recommendation is new list-maps have a merge key of
     name.  When merge keys aren’t manually specified, this is the default
     one.

4. All information conveyed should be as structured as possible

5. Naming in the IDL describes the serialized form.  Language bindings
   (Go) are derived automatically from that.  Specific overrides for
   legacy codebases occur via markers, since they are exceptions to the
   rules.

## Design Notes

### Uhhh, where are the proto tags?

Earlier versions of this proposal included a specific syntax for adding
proto tags (`myField[42]: optional string` introduces a field named
`myField` with a tag of `42`). However, this syntax was not entirely
obvious.

The current plan is to place proto tags in a look-aside file that will
only ever be appended to, and will be managed by the compiler.  This has
the *slight* downside of requiring extra scrutiny on field renames, but
has the upside that users *don't have to care* or learn about how proto
tags work, why we'd have to leave room for reserved fields in kinds, etc.

The tags will still be present in the CKDL file, meaning that tooling has
proto tags available for use all from a single file, while humans don't
have to bother with them.

### What's up with markers?

Markers are intended to be the extension mechanism for the language. 
They’re intended to allow “marking” (a.k.a. annotating) fields and types
with tooling-specific details.

The general pattern is that things involved in the standard serialization
pipeline are built into the language: JSON-focused field naming, type data
(types, optionality, extra constraints like validation, etc).

These represent the “happy path” of details that all API authors (builtin,
CRD) need to care about, as well as details that most (if not all)
serialization & generation pipelines will need to consider (practically,
they have first-class representations in CKDL well).

On the other hand, things that are specific to a particular code
generation pipeline, or that add additional informational data intended to
be picked up by certain linters, etc, will generally be markers.

**So why not just make everything a marker?** This comes down to visual
interpretation: separating out type data from additional data makes it
easier to visually scan for details, review, etc: you know where to look
for what data.

This plays into the positioning of markers as well -- markers go above,
type modifiers go inline.  This is mirrored across most languages with
such an extension point.

From a serialized perspective, it makes it easier for folks writing code
that consumes CKDL to know what they must deal with.  If everything is an
extension in the serialized CKDL, it’s hard to look and know what the
structure of the serialized form is.

*That being said*, syntactically, markers and “type modifiers” (everything
after the colon) use the same syntax (`key ~ named_param_list?`) modulo
the `@`, so it’s possible that we could make that positioning an
"either-or" -- `@foo(...)` above a field, or just `foo(...)` inline. 
However, this makes it harder to know where to look for certain bits of
data when reading KDL, so it’s not clear to me what the benefit is beyond
a conceptual linguistic equivalence.

## Unresolved/Open Issues

<<[UNRESOLVED @directxman12]>>
Earlier versions of this proposal involved specifying marker definitions
using proto files, since they compile down to proto messages.  It was
pointed out that this is a bit hacky, so the proposal was switched to
allow defining markers via KDL instead (and just translating that to the
proto definitions).  Exact syntax is still tbd, but I'd imagine it'd look
like:

```
marker deprecated {
    msg: string,
}
```
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>

<<[UNRESOLVED @sttts]>>

We're missing atomic on structs and simple-maps.

@directxman12: Should be a fairly straightfoward addition to the parameter
list of both.  Don't think they need separate syntactic constructs --
they're close enough as concepts.

<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>

<<[UNRESOLVED @sttts]>>

Overlay syntax to add nested validation to existing types

Maybe either

```
struct MySpec {
  template: SpecialPodSpec,
}
overlay(base: Pod::Spec) SpecialPodSpec {
  containers: SpecialContainer,

  overlay(base: Pod::Spec::Container) SpecialContainer {
    name: string validates(pattern: "foo-.+"),
  }
}
```

or 

```
struct MySpec {
   template: core/v1::Pod::Spec sub-validates(path: .containers.name, pattern: "foo-.+"),
}
```

<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>

<<[UNRESOLVED @thockin]>>

Call simple-map "dict" instead.

@directxman12: the goal was to draw a parallel between maps of structs,
for which Kubernetes uses `list-map` and maps of primitives and primitive
slices, for which kubernetes uses a "normal" map.  The goal is that people
who reach for "map" a explicitly presented with a choice.  Consider,
instead, if we just called them `map` and `list-map` -- folks not familiar
with k8s would reach for `map`, and then get frustrated/confused when it
didn't work.

<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>

<<[UNRESOLVED @thockin]>>

Elide the key in simple cases for parameter lists?

@directxman12: this makes the language a bit less straightforward, but it
should be possible to come up with a rule that's both ergonomic & doesn't
have the pitfalls of normal positional arguments and backwards compat
(e.g. maybe we say `value` may be elided when used as the first argument).

## Formal(-ish) Grammar

***Author's note***: the canonical source for this grammar is [in the

```
// a note on syntax for this file: the syntax for this file
// roughly follows the [pest](https://pest.rs) syntax, for
// various historical reasons & since there's no single standard
// for ebnf.
//
// TL;DR:
// - `~` means adjacent, but can include whitespace or comments
// - `*`, `+`, `?`, `|`, and parentheses have their usual meanings
// - `@` before the braces of a rule indicates that no whitespace
//   or comments may be present between tokens unless explicitly
//   noted (i.e. `~` means *immediately adjacent*).
// - `!` means look-ahead negation, so `!NEWLINE ~ ANY` means any
//   character that's not a newline.

file = { SOI ~ imports? ~ qualified_decl+ ~ group_version+ ~ EOI }

// imports may either be types or marker (see below)
// defintions

// group-versions may be specified per file, and we can mark
// that we need specific group-versions from a file.

//
// ```
