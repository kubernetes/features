## Summary

The proposal aims to improve the Pod's ability to obtain the address of the node

## Motivation

### Goals

- Field `status.hostIPs` added for Pod
- Downward API support for `status.hostIPs`

### Non-Goals

## Proposal

### User Stories

#### Story 1

In some scenarios, the application needs to know the both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed, and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed, and by whom?

Consider including folks who also work outside the SIG or subproject.
-->

## Design Details

### Versioned API Change: PodStatus v1 core

In order to maintain backwards compatibility for the core V1 API, this proposal
retains the existing (singular) "HostIP" field in the core V1 version of the
PodStatus V1 core API and adds a new array of structures that store host IPs
along with associated metadata for that IP.

``` go
    // HostIP address of the host to which the pod is assigned. Empty if not yet scheduled.
    // +optional
    HostIP string

    // HostIP represents the IP address of a host.
    // IP address information. Each entry includes:
    //    IP: An IP address allocated to the host.
    type HostIP struct {
      // ip is an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) assigned to the host
      IP string
    }

    // HostIPs holds the IP addresses allocated to the host. If this field is specified, the 0th entry must
    // match the hostIP field. This list is empty if no IPs have been allocated yet.
    // +optional
    HostIPs []HostIP
```

### PodStatus Internal Representation

PodStatus internally indicates that the original use of HostIP will remain unchanged,
and HostIPs is added for subsequent use

``` go
    // HostIP address information for entries in the (plural) HostIPs field.
    // Each entry includes:
    //    IP: An IP address allocated to the host.
    type HostIP struct {
      // ip is an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) assigned to the host
      IP string `json:"ip,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,1,opt,name=ip"`
    }

    // HostIPs holds the IP addresses allocated to the host. If this field is specified, the 0th entry must
    // match the hostIP field. This list is empty if no IPs have been allocated yet.
    // +optional
    // +patchStrategy=merge
    // +patchMergeKey=ip
    HostIPs []HostIP `json:"hostIPs,omitempty" protobuf:"bytes,14,rep,name=hostIPs" patchStrategy:"merge" patchMergeKey:"ip"`
```

### Maintaining Compatible Interworking between Old and New Clients

#### V1 to Core (Internal) Conversion

- If only V1 HostIP is provided:
  - Copy V1 HostIP to core HostIPs[0]
- Else if only V1 HostIPs[] is provided:
  - Copy V1 HostIPs[] to core HostIPs[]
- Else if both V1 HostIP and V1 HostIPs[] are provided:
  - Verify that V1 HostIP matches V1 HostIPs[0]
  - Copy V1 HostIPs[] to core HostIPs[]
- Delete any duplicates in core HostIPs[]

#### Core (Internal) to V1 Conversion

- Copy core HostIPs[0] to V1 HostIP
- Copy core HostIPs[] to V1 HostIPs[]


### Container Environment Variables

The Downward API [status.hostIP](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/downward-api-volume-expose-pod-information/#capabilities-of-the-downward-api)
will preserve the existing single IP address, and will be set to the default IP
for each pod. A new environmental variable named `status.hostIPs` will contain a
space-separated list of IP addresses. The new pod API will have a slice of
structures for the additional IP addresses. Kubelet will translate the pod
structures and return hostIPs as a comma-delimited string.

Here is an example of how to define a pluralized `MY_HOST_IPS` environmental
variable in a pod definition yaml file:

``` yaml
- name: MY_HOST_IPS
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: status.hostIPs
```

This definition will cause an environmental variable setting in the pod similar
to the following:

```
# PodHostIPs FeatureGate is enabled
MY_HOST_IPS=fd00:10:20:0:3::3,10.20.3.3

# PodHostIPs FeatureGate is disabled
MY_HOST_IPS=fd00:10:20:0:3::3
```

### Test Plan

Test whether FeatureGate behaves as expected when it is turned on or off
Test whether Downward API supports `status.hostIPs`

#### Expected behavior

- If PodHostIPs FeatureGate is enabled:
  - If IPv6DualStack FeatureGate is enabled:
    - `status.hostIPs` there will be both IPv4 and IPv6
  - Else:
    - There will only be one, same as `status.hostIP`
- Else:
  - `status.hostIPs` will be null and the ApiServer will reject Downward API `status.hostIPs`, 
    if Pods already existing Downward API `status.hostIPs`, ensure to ignore it and not affect others.

### Graduation Criteria

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, or as something else. The KEP
should keep this high-level with a focus on what signals will be looked at to
determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha -> Beta Graduation

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### Beta -> GA Graduation

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testing—e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

#### Removing a Deprecated Flag

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include 
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

### Version Skew Strategy

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

### Feature Enablement and Rollback

###### How can this feature be enabled / disabled in a live cluster?

- [x] Feature gate (also fill in values in `kep.yaml`)
  - Feature gate name:
  - Components depending on the feature gate:
- [ ] Other
  - Describe the mechanism:
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime of the control
    plane?
  - Will enabling / disabling the feature require downtime or reprovisioning
    of a node? (Do not assume `Dynamic Kubelet Config` feature is enabled).

###### Does enabling the feature change any default behavior?

No.

###### Can the feature be disabled once it has been enabled (i.e. can we roll back the enablement)?

Yes. Using the featuregate is the only way to enable/disable this feature.

###### What happens if we reenable the feature if it was previously rolled back?

The feature should continue to work just fine.

###### Are there any tests for feature enablement/disablement?

<!--
The e2e framework does not currently support enabling or disabling feature
gates. However, unit tests in each component dealing with managing data, created
with and without the feature, are necessary. At the very least, think about
conversion tests if API types are being modified.
-->

### Rollout, Upgrade and Rollback Planning

###### How can a rollout or rollback fail? Can it impact already running workloads?

No.

###### What specific metrics should inform a rollback?

None.

###### Were upgrade and rollback tested? Was the upgrade->downgrade->upgrade path tested?

No.

###### Is the rollout accompanied by any deprecations and/or removals of features, APIs, fields of API types, flags, etc.?

No.

### Monitoring Requirements

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### How can an operator determine if the feature is in use by workloads?

<!--
Ideally, this should be a metric. Operations against the Kubernetes API (e.g.,
checking if there are objects with field X set) may be a last resort. Avoid
logs or events for this purpose.
-->

###### How can someone using this feature know that it is working for their instance?

<!--
For instance, if this is a pod-related feature, it should be possible to determine if the feature is functioning properly
for each individual pod.
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
Please describe all items visible to end users below with sufficient detail so that they can verify correct enablement
and operation of this feature.
Recall that end users cannot usually observe component logs or access metrics.
-->

- [ ] Events
  - Event Reason: 
- [ ] API .status
  - Condition name: 
  - Other field: 
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### What are the reasonable SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for the enhancement?

<!--
This is your opportunity to define what "normal" quality of service looks like
for a feature.

It's impossible to provide comprehensive guidance, but at the very
high level (needs more precise definitions) those may be things like:
  - per-day percentage of API calls finishing with 5XX errors <= 1%
  - 99% percentile over day of absolute value from (job creation time minus expected
    job creation time) for cron job <= 10%
  - 99.9% of /health requests per day finish with 200 code

These goals will help you determine what you need to measure (SLIs) in the next
question.
-->

###### What are the SLIs (Service Level Indicators) an operator can use to determine the health of the service?

<!--
Pick one more of these and delete the rest.
-->

- [ ] Metrics
  - Metric name:
  - [Optional] Aggregation method:
  - Components exposing the metric:
- [ ] Other (treat as last resort)
  - Details:

###### Are there any missing metrics that would be useful to have to improve observability of this feature?

<!--
Describe the metrics themselves and the reasons why they weren't added (e.g., cost,
implementation difficulties, etc.).
-->

### Dependencies

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.
-->

###### Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster?

<!--
Think about both cluster-level services (e.g. metrics-server) as well
as node-level agents (e.g. specific version of CRI). Focus on external or
optional services that are needed. For example, if this feature depends on
a cloud provider API, or upon an external software-defined storage or network
control plane.

For each of these, fill in the following—thinking about running existing user workloads
and creating new ones, as well as about cluster-level services (e.g. DNS):
  - [Dependency name]
    - Usage description:
      - Impact of its outage on the feature:
      - Impact of its degraded performance or high-error rates on the feature:
-->

### Scalability

<!--
For alpha, this section is encouraged: reviewers should consider these questions
and attempt to answer them.

For beta, this section is required: reviewers must answer these questions.

For GA, this section is required: approvers should be able to confirm the
previous answers based on experience in the field.
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new API calls?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API call type (e.g. PATCH pods)
  - estimated throughput
  - originating component(s) (e.g. Kubelet, Feature-X-controller)
Focusing mostly on:
  - components listing and/or watching resources they didn't before
  - API calls that may be triggered by changes of some Kubernetes resources
    (e.g. update of object X triggers new updates of object Y)
  - periodic API calls to reconcile state (e.g. periodic fetching state,
    heartbeats, leader election, etc.)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in introducing new API types?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type
  - Supported number of objects per cluster
  - Supported number of objects per namespace (for namespace-scoped objects)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in any new calls to the cloud provider?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - Which API(s):
  - Estimated increase:
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing size or count of the existing API objects?

<!--
Describe them, providing:
  - API type(s):
  - Estimated increase in size: (e.g., new annotation of size 32B)
  - Estimated amount of new objects: (e.g., new Object X for every existing Pod)
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in increasing time taken by any operations covered by existing SLIs/SLOs?

<!--
Look at the [existing SLIs/SLOs].

Think about adding additional work or introducing new steps in between
(e.g. need to do X to start a container), etc. Please describe the details.

[existing SLIs/SLOs]: https://git.k8s.io/community/sig-scalability/slos/slos.md#kubernetes-slisslos
-->

###### Will enabling / using this feature result in non-negligible increase of resource usage (CPU, RAM, disk, IO, ...) in any components?

<!--
Things to keep in mind include: additional in-memory state, additional
non-trivial computations, excessive access to disks (including increased log
volume), significant amount of data sent and/or received over network, etc.
This through this both in small and large cases, again with respect to the
[supported limits].

[supported limits]: https://git.k8s.io/community//sig-scalability/configs-and-limits/thresholds.md
-->

### Troubleshooting

<!--
This section must be completed when targeting beta to a release.

The Troubleshooting section currently serves the `Playbook` role. We may consider
splitting it into a dedicated `Playbook` document (potentially with some monitoring
details). For now, we leave it here.
-->

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

###### What are other known failure modes?

<!--
For each of them, fill in the following information by copying the below template:
  - [Failure mode brief description]
    - Detection: How can it be detected via metrics? Stated another way:
      how can an operator troubleshoot without logging into a master or worker node?
    - Mitigations: What can be done to stop the bleeding, especially for already
      running user workloads?
    - Diagnostics: What are the useful log messages and their required logging
      levels that could help debug the issue?
      Not required until feature graduated to beta.
    - Testing: Are there any tests for failure mode? If not, describe why.
-->

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

## Infrastructure Needed (Optional)

<!--
Use this section if you need things from the project/SIG. Examples include a
new subproject, repos requested, or GitHub details. Listing these here allows a
SIG to get the process for these resources started right away.
-->
