## Summary

Provide an interface so that users can implement a custom queue of scheduler.
With such, users can build their custom queue implementation at will, and plumb into
the scheduler seamlessly. This can satisfy the business needs such as sophisticated
pods sorting and internal queuing mechanics.

## Motivation

The current internal queue implementation ([scheduling_queue.go#PriorityQueue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/ee459b8969ed2abfed79a07d4ac9d41f13f18ce6/pkg/scheduler/internal/queue/scheduling_queue.go#L126))
works for most cases, but the limited interfaces exposure makes it hard to
implement a scheduler plugin for sophisticated requirements.

One requirement in terms of multi-tenancy support:  
There are many pods from 2 users (userA and userB), and the target is to ensure resource
usage (E.g. userA gets x CPUs) ratio between userA and userB is 1:1. Sorting the pods by
the resource usage in `Less` function doesn't work properly, because the resource usage for
userA/userB will be updated dynamically once a pod is selected and bound, while the
algorithm (heapsort) that used by the current queue to get the next pods depends on static
data.

Other requirements come from current semi-exposed functions/parameters:
For example, the interval of function flushUnschedulableQLeftover, although configurable,
is immutable after it gets initialized. A requirement is to adjust the interval dynamically
based on the pressure of pending workloads (e.g., length of queue or other metrics).

Given that the business needs may vary greatly, it'd be desirable to provide a replaceable
`SchedulerQueue` interface and plumbing mechanics. So that the developers can
implement their custom queue implementation, while the upstream maintainers focus
on keeping the core small and extensible, and thus only maintain the internal queue piece.

### Goals

1. Support custom queue implementation of the scheduler.
2. Roll out the design gradually. In phase 1, keep current internal queue implementation
intact.

### Non-Goals

Support custom rules for pod selection in the current internal queue of scheduler.

## Proposal

Provide an interface like current scheduler plugins, users can provide a
custom queue of scheduler and register it, then the kubernetes
scheduler will use this custom queue for pod management.

This is an extension of the current scheduler plugins, users can control
more details of the scheduler with this enhancement.

Pros:  
Users can get full control of the pod queuing logic, they can pop/re-queue/backoff pods with
custom logic.

The scheduler plugins design is enhanced, the custom queue and the extension
points can work together to meet more requests.

Cons:  
Users need to understand the details of the current queue which has 13
functions now, it is not easy to implement a custom queue.

### Risks and Mitigations

A poor-implemented queue may not function well, in both functionality and performance.
But the default scheduler works as before and thus won't be impacted.

## Design Details

The scheduler internal queue, as its name implies, was originally implemented for internal
usage. Due to that, some structs (like cache, Option) are not designed for external extension,
and the internal queue is initialized with specified parameters like LessFunc,
SharedInformerFactory, and Option by [factory.go#create](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/f1f0183d2bbcde33024b2a05d6f39df32f11e037/pkg/scheduler/factory.go#L172). Although refactoring the internal queuing mechanics to be reusable/extensible is the eventual
goal, we'd like to approach that gradually, and thus is not the goal of phase 1 of this design.
In phase 1, we'd like to exercise the idea of "a replaceable scheduler queue" in a "minimal viable product"
manner.

A practical design for phase 1 is described as below:

1. Make `SchedulingQueue` a public interface. Users can choose to implement their own queue.

2. Provide a new function `WithCustomQueue`, so users can register the custom queue with this
function like other plugins.

    ```go
         command := app.NewSchedulerCommand(
             app.WithPlugin(coscheduling.Name, coscheduling.New),
             ......
       +     app.WithCustomQueue(customQueue.New),
         )
    ```

3. The registered custom queue will be recorded by updated `Registry` struct.

    ```go
      type Registry struct {
          Pf          map[string]PluginFactory
          CustomQueue schedulingQueue.SchedulingQueue
      }
    ```

4. In function `(c *Configurator) create()`, custom queue will be passed to the scheduler
if it exists, or the current internal queue will be used.

    ```go
      - podQueue := internalqueue.NewSchedulingQueue(
      -         lessFn,
      +
      + var podQueue framework.SchedulingQueue
      + if c.registry.CustomQueue != nil {
      +         podQueue = c.registry.CustomQueue
      + } else {
      +         podQueue = &internalqueue.PriorityQueue{}
      + }
      + podQueue.Init(...)
    ```

5. Basic inputs for queue's initialization will not be changed, a new method `Init` is added in
the interface `SchedulingQueue`, users must implement it.

    ```go
      + func (p *PriorityQueue) Init(
      +        lessFn framework.LessFunc,
      +        informerFactory informers.SharedInformerFactory,
      +        opts ...framework.Option,
      + ) {
    ```

To get started with the implementation, an easy way is to copy the codes of the current
internal queue (i.e., scheduling_queue.go), and then update the logic in-place to adapt to
the business needs (it's very like how some out-of-tree PostFilter plugin refers to the
defaultpreemption plugin). With the custom queue handle, users can pass it to the scheduler like the
plugins. Following this way, the user's custom scheduler queue will override the upstream internal queue.

### Test Plan

- **Unit Tests**: All core changes must be covered by unit tests.
- **Integration Tests**: At least one integration test to craft a custom queue to exercise an end-to-end flow.
- **Benchmark Tests**: The performance benchmark test result is same as before if custom queue is not used.

### Graduation Criteria

#### Alpha -> Beta Graduation

- Users can implement their own custom queues.
- No user complaints regarding correctness.

#### Beta -> GA Graduation

- Allowing time for feedback to ensure that the new interface sufficiently expresses users requirements.

## Production Readiness Review Questionnaire

<!--

Production readiness reviews are intended to ensure that features merging into
Kubernetes are observable, scalable and supportable; can be safely operated in
production environments, and can be disabled or rolled back in the event they
cause increased failures in production. See more in the PRR KEP at
https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-architecture/1194-prod-readiness.

The production readiness review questionnaire must be completed and approved
for the KEP to move to `implementable` status and be included in the release.

In some cases, the questions below should also have answers in `kep.yaml`. This
is to enable automation to verify the presence of the review, and to reduce review
burden and latency.

The KEP must have a approver from the
[`prod-readiness-approvers`](http://git.k8s.io/enhancements/OWNERS_ALIASES)
team. Please reach out on the
[#prod-readiness](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CPNHUMN74) channel if
you need any help or guidance.

No

### Troubleshooting

The user who provides custom queue is responsible for providing troubleshooting messages/events.

###### How does this feature react if the API server and/or etcd is unavailable?

It depends on the related logics in custom queue.

###### What are other known failure modes?

No

###### What steps should be taken if SLOs are not being met to determine the problem?

Using the current queue as a workaround and check the logics in custom queue.

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

## Alternatives

An alternative is to enhance the current queue to meet some requests. The drawback
is that we cannot handle all the potential requests as the effort is big, we should
give the ball to the users, and they can do what they want.
